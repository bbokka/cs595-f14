		<p>I blinked rapidly twice, I was very weak, I had not fed in a week, and I could feel The Thirst closing in upon me.<br />
Evening approached as I sauntered down the streets of Venice, I watched the people closely looking for someone to feed on-I am a man of class, and I am very selective when it comes to my choice of victims, and right then, it was a very hard thing to do, because, I hated having to thirst before I feed. As I walked on, my vision blurred for a moment, I cleared it with a shake of my beautiful head, I took a couple of steps forward and then it hit me with full force-The Thirst, I lurched forward for a semi-second, my pupils began to dilate rapidly, and before anybody could notice any change in my appearance, I slithered to a dark corner in an alley, I was safe for the moment.<br />
Now, I shall describe “The Thirst” for you so that you will understand why it cannot be ignored. Blood to me is like air, I need it to survive, imagine yourself as a mortal running out of air, that is how I feel when the thirst hits, but as thirsty as I felt, I still waited for the right victim.<br />
Minutes passed, I did not lose patience, for this is an essential character which I possess in abundance, it’s what makes me a very good hunter, my wait was not in vain, a beautiful lady passed by the alley, I wondered why she was alone, but I did not wonder for long, I had a pressing need. I followed her, and as she walked, I took the whole of her into my mind; she was of average height, blonde, she also looked classy, it was all in the walk, I looked around, it was now or later, I floated to her rear, and dug my fangs into her slender neck- I am not the type to play with my prey. In seconds, I was done. I felt so good then and almost satisfied, the same way you would feel if you recieved something you have been longing for.<br />
My hands in my pocket, I strolled up the street, heading home. I looked up, and I saw a man looking at me intently, he had noticed something about me<br />
“Your eyes” he said.<br />
“What’s wrong with them?”, I replied.<br />
“They’re red-rimmed”, he said.<br />
I cursed under my breath, definitely he knows what I am, but I decided to let him go, and I walked past him. However, I was wrong for being nice to him, in half a second, he had pulled out a silver dagger, which was headed to my chest as I could tell, I was faster than that, I looped off the dagger from his grip, and heard it hit the pavement. Still, I walked on, not in the mood to kill him, but as fate would prove him ready, he insisted on making sure he would be the one to rid me of this world. He stepped forward with a crucifix, aimed at my chest, I glided smoothly to his back, and with a very light shove, pushed his spinal cord out of his body, I watched him fall to the ground lifeless in seconds, I sighed, “you didn’t have to die, all you had to do was walk away”, I thought.<br />
I looked around, and there was a little boy not far away from where I had commited this gruesome act, I ignored him, and sauntered up the street, feeling satisfied, and dis-satisfied</p>

		<p>It had been a long journey, I reckoned as I approached the temple from the west entrance. I snorted out dust from my nostrils, ran my hands through my hair and shook my hair to get rid of the dust in it. I looked down at my boots, they were encrusted in dust, I stomped my feet against the ground one after the other to get rid of the dust and shook my coat as I entered the temple.<br />
As usual, the temple was empty, a little bell was jingling as the wind from the eastern window blew it leisurely. I stretched my entire body and flexed my neck muscles as I approached the altar. I knelt down and placed my 5-feet sword, Isis on the floor beside me. As I was about to start saying my prayers, I heard a rustle behind the curtains at my left side. I rolled my eyeballs slightly to the left, as this was a mean to look around without turning my head. The rustling ceased, then I saw a figure clad in purple flit across the temple to my right side. My mind was no longer on the prayers I was about to say, they were now more fixated on whatever creature was darting around the temple. I heard a swish at my back and just in time, I blocked a sword with Isis. In seconds, I analysed my current situation; I still had one of my knees on the floor, my body twisted a few degrees backwards, my arms extended with Isis holding another sword bearing a striking resemblance to it at bay. I looked up from the sword at its wielder, he was a man of average build, like me, with skin as white as snow. He had jet-black, shoulder-length hair, with a part of his hair covering his left eye. He had a crooked smile on his face and he had yellow eyes, with green specks in the pupils, just like mine.<br />
I pushed at him with my sword, forcing him to move back. I got my other knee off the ground and stood to face him. He jumped, I jumped too, we met in midair, our swords clashing in the air, sending sparks of light into the air. I muttered a quick prayer as I engaged him in a swordfight that lasted half an hour.<br />
Now and then, we slashed at each other, never scoring, for we were equally matched. I could feel my arms growing tired for wielding Isis for so long, and considering the fact that I had just arrived from a long journey. I lashed out my right foot at my opponent, he blocked, and I flipped back off his arm, buying myself space and time. I cast Isis aside and whipped out my guns from my side holster, squeezing repeatedly at the triggers, firing rounds after rounds at him. He was very quick, blocking every single bullet with his sword. Suddenly, he was in front of me, and in one fluid movement, he slashed his sword at my face. With my eyes wide open from the surprise at the speed at which he appeared in front of me, I evaded the sword, but I was too slow, for his sword cut my left cheekbone. I gasped as I felt blood erupt from the cut. I withdrew to a corner and put my left hand up to my face, I wiped the blood and looked. My left hand was smeared with my blood, my own blood. A new rage crept into me as the sight of the blue liquid infuriated me greatly.<br />
Looking at my adversary, I pulled off my coat and cast aside my shirt, then I picked up Isis again and charged at him, filled with new strength from the rage that coursed through me. I was moving too quick for him now and I succeeded in landing a few blows on his body. He staggered backwards, weakened as he dropped to the ground. I flung Isis aside and picked him up with my left hand, pummeling his face with my right. I punched him til the rage in me had coursed out. I threw him at the north end of the temple, and as he sailed across the temple, I hurled his sword at his midsection. It impaled him to the wall.<br />
With a deep sigh, I turned my back to him and was about to walk to where I dropped my coat when I heard a creak. I turned now to see him pulling the sword out of his body. When he had pulled it out of his body, he dropped to the ground and stood again. I could see his face, clean as ever and wondered how many punches I had administered to it. Was it not enough? I could see the spot where the sword had impaled him closing up rapidly. I frowned and uttered my first words to him “what are you?”. In response, he said “I am just like you…” He tossed a little grenade in the air, the blast created an opening in the roof, and he leapt in the air, pulling himself up through the opening. I said to him in anger and frustration “But…there is none like me” “Talk to father” he said in response. I fired shots at him as he disappeared.<br />
As I walked to pick up my coat, I couldn’t help the feeling that I had been lied to, for so long, I had thought I was my father’s only son.</p>

		<p>I’ve been sitting here for the<br />
past five hours at the workshop trying<br />
to get my phone repaired. I’m pretty<br />
much frustrated at the moment and it’s<br />
all over my face, if not all over my body.<br />
This is the price I have to pay for being<br />
a developer. This is it.<br />
                Last night, I was copying some<br />
game files from a friend’s droid to my<br />
phone and I was a little excited because<br />
I thought I was going to get some real<br />
action as soon as I was through with the<br />
exams, so I copied about 10Gig worth of<br />
game files, these games were dope, 3D<br />
games, I’m talking about games like<br />
“Amazing Spiderman”, “FIFA 14”, and<br />
everything was going quite smoothly, I<br />
couldn’t even feel the hungry worms<br />
eating away at my stomach, I was<br />
engrossed in the copying of these files.<br />
(Come to think of it, this long wait is<br />
making me feel the hunger real bad and<br />
I can’t leave my phone with this repair<br />
guy, I don’t trust him that much).<br />
                So, I finished late in the night<br />
and I proceeded to copy the game files<br />
to my droid. I was excited. I installed the<br />
first one- AVB Revolution or some shit<br />
like that. It played, and this motivated<br />
me to install the other games too. I<br />
copied the game files for FIFA14 and<br />
installed it, that one played too.<br />
Awesome!, so I proceeded with<br />
“Amazing Spiderman” and was quite<br />
successful with that one too, then I<br />
installed it and opened the app. Well, it<br />
did play, opened the menu and I felt the<br />
graphics and I was like “Wow, this is<br />
some dope shit”, then after the whole<br />
loading process, only to start the game<br />
and the app booted off to the home<br />
screen. “What?” you could basically see<br />
this written on my face as I realized that<br />
the game’s graphics was way too heavy<br />
for my phone to play it. ( This is a game<br />
that has HD and 3D qualities.) Then I<br />
remembered seeing an app on my<br />
friend’s droid that allowed the game run<br />
smoothly- “ChainFire 3D”, so I promptly<br />
went to the Play Store and downloaded<br />
me some ChainFire, thinking all the while<br />
that I was up for some dope gaming as<br />
soon as I tweaked my droid with this<br />
app. I downloaded Chainfire and<br />
installed it, ran it and saw a warning that<br />
I didn’t pay attention to, a warning that<br />
would cost me #3000 today and I totally<br />
ignored it, on some I’m-a-droid-guy-I-<br />
can-handle-this-shit level. Then my<br />
phone rebooted and it couldn’t boot<br />
past the manufacturer logo, I thought<br />
my phone was messing with me,<br />
removed the battery and rebooted<br />
again, the same thing happened. I had<br />
encountered a boot loop error. I hard<br />
reset the droid to no avail, did<br />
everything I could do to the droid, as a<br />
developer, even tried downloading a<br />
custom ROM to flash it with, but my<br />
school’s WiFi proper messed up, a snail<br />
would win a race against it. Then I<br />
realized that the only option available<br />
was to give it up to the professionals,<br />
and yeah, that’s why I’m here right now.<br />
Well, the professional just walked up to<br />
me now to tell me that I can’t collect my<br />
droid today, tomorrow it is, I can’t even<br />
cry. I’m a man, but my phone is like the<br />
only companion I have. This is sad,<br />
right? *sighs* I gotta shut down this<br />
netbook now, trying to conserve the<br />
power on it, I’m in Nigeria</p>

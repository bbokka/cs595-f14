According to a census done by the Census Bureau as of July 1, 2012, the city had a population of 130,741. New Haven is the principal municipality in Greater New Haven, which had a total population of 862,477 in 2010. It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern shore of the Long Island Sound in New Haven County, which in turn comprises a part of the New York metropolitan area.<\/p>\n<p>New Haven was founded in 1638 by English Puritans, and a year later eight streets were laid out in a four-by-four grid, creating what is now commonly known as the \"Nine Square Plan\", now recognized by the American Institute of Certified Planners as a National Planning Landmark. The central common block is New Haven Green, a 16-acre (6 ha) square, now a National Historic Landmark and the center of Downtown New Haven.<\/p>\n<p>New Haven is the home of the Ivy League school Yale University. The university is an integral part of the city's economy, being New Haven's biggest taxpayer and employer, Health care (hospitals and biotechnology), professional services (legal, architectural, marketing, and engineering), financial services, and retail trade also help to form an economic base for the city.<\/p>\n<p>The city served as co-capital of Connecticut from 1701 until 1873, when sole governance was transferred to the more centrally-located city of Hartford. New Haven has since billed itself as the \"Cultural Capital of Connecticut\" for its supply of established theaters, museums, and music venues.<\/p>\n<p>New Haven had the first public tree planting program in America, producing a canopy of mature trees (including some large elms) that gave New Haven the nickname \"The Elm City\".<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-10-01T10:56:02","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Haven,_Connecticut\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1232","category":"Town","slug":"new-haven-ct-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Haven,_Connecticut","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/new-haven-ct-us\/","woeid":2458410,"placetype":"Town","livevideo":"","item_count":111,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1232","longitude":-72.9223,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1232\/","geohash":"drk4ux9xk3dc","daily_count":3,"latitude":41.3036,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/T2","name":"New Haven, CT, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-haven-ct-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":273,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/36\/Large_bonfire.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Fire<\/b> is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","slug":"crime-courts","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","recent_count":11,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":43905,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","geohash":"","daily_count":31,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","moderation_status":"approved"}]},{"type":"text","status":"published","source":null,"whoas":5,"id":446902,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CBSPittsburgh\/status\/518154133153787904","name":"KDKA","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451757169629614080\/8rpHlYBU_normal.jpeg","date":"2014-10-03T21:42:26","location":"Pittsburgh, PA","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518154133153787904","screen_name":"CBSPittsburgh","id":249166,"user_id":"14085099","content":"#BREAKING: Tankers are now shuttling in water to put out Flight 93 Memorial Fire, no fire hydrant in the area. http:\/\/t.co\/D7WzZ18DGY"},"slug":"breaking-tankers-are-now-shuttling-in-water-to-p","content":"Tankers are now shuttling in water to put out Flight 93 Memorial Fire;

This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"fixed\" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-05-07T04:22:52","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=273","category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","slug":"fires","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/fires\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":7388,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=273","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/273\/","geohash":"","daily_count":10,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EZ","name":"fires","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fires\/","moderation_status":"approved"}]},{"type":"text","status":"published","source":null,"whoas":7,"id":446901,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Variety\/status\/518153673591889920","name":"Variety","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/467021234920620032\/-K05Alwz_normal.jpeg","date":"2014-10-03T21:40:37","location":"Los Angeles, CA","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518153673591889920","screen_name":"Variety","id":249164,"user_id":"17525171","content":"Michael Goldberg, Who Scripted Jamaican Bobsled Film ‘Cool Runnings,’ Dies at 55 http:\/\/t.co\/3zceGHmRrr"},"slug":"michael-goldberg-who-wrote-the-script-for-jamaica","content":"Michael Goldberg, who wrote the script for Jamaican bobsled film 'Cool Runnings,' has died at age 55 - @Variety","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/michael-goldberg-who-wrote-the-script-for-jamaica","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 09:42 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vFGZ5e","url_domain":"variety.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446901\/","push_content":"Michael Goldberg, who wrote the script for Jamaican bobsled film 'Cool Runnings,' has died at age 55 - @Variety","updated_date":"2014-10-03T21:42:24.513706","submitter":"editor","author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2QF","url":"http:\/\/variety.com\/interstitial\/#u=http:\/\/variety.com\/2014\/film\/people-news\/michael-goldberg-who-scripted-jamaican-bobsled-film-cool-runnings-dies-at-55-1201320707;k=pmc-adi-31bb2464aad8b905af7a81e1d57b77ae","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T21:42:18.819742","importance":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/michael-goldberg-who-wrote-the-script-for-jamaica","topics":[{"id":9904,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0a\/Flag_of_Jamaica.svg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Jamaica<\/b> (\/dʒəˈmeɪkə\/) is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, comprising the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences, that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.<\/p>\n<p>The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p>Films recorded in analog form traditionally included an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.<\/p>\n<p>Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence and its sexist treatment of women.<\/p>\n<p>The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection of traditional films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called phi phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>The name \"film\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including <i>picture<\/i>, <i>picture show<\/i>, <i>moving picture<\/i>, <i>photoplay<\/i> and <i>flick<\/i>. The most common term in the United States is <i>movie<\/i>, while in Europe <i>film<\/i> is preferred. Terms for the field in general include <i>the big screen<\/i>, <i>the silver screen<\/i>, <i>the movies<\/i> and <i>cinema<\/i>; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word <i>sheet<\/i> was sometimes used instead of <i>screen<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-11T02:56:34","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=89","category":"Topic","slug":"film","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/film\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1036,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=89","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/89\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bb","name":"film","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:42:18.819742","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/film\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85276,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T21:41:24.126075","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85276","category":"Person","slug":"michael-goldberg","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/michael-goldberg\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85276","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85276\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WLa","name":"Michael Goldberg","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:42:18.819742","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/michael-goldberg\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":75,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","category":"Topic","slug":"entertainment","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":7417,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","geohash":"","daily_count":3,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","name":"entertainment","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:42:18.819742","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":43347,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/ObituariesontheWall.jpg","links":"","description":"<p>An <b>obituary<\/b> is a news article that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral.

However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports, although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news.

As of the 2010 census, the city's population is 820,445. It is the 12th largest city in the United States and the 29th largest metropolitan area in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Indianapolis has oriented itself around government (a byproduct of its state capital function) and industry, particularly manufacturing. Over the late decades of the 20th century, the city's Unigov began a long process to revitalize the downtown area. Today, Indianapolis has a much more diversified economy, contributing to the fields of education, health care, and finance. Tourism is also a vital part of the economy of Indianapolis, with the city playing host to numerous conventions and sporting events. Of these, perhaps the most well known are the annual Indianapolis 500, Brickyard 400, and NHRA U.S. Nationals. Other major sporting events include the annual Big Ten Conference football championship and the Men's and Women's NCAA basketball tournaments. Indianapolis also hosted the Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Both <i>Forbes<\/i> and <i>Livability.com<\/i> rank Indianapolis as one of the best downtowns in the United States citing \"more than 200 retail shops, more than 35 hotels, nearly 300 restaurants and food options, movie theaters, sports venues, museums, art galleries and parks\" as attractions. Greater Indianapolis has seen moderate growth among U.S. cities. The population of the metropolitan statistical area was 1,756,241 according to the 2010 Census, making it the 34th-largest in the United States. The 2010 population of the Indianapolis combined statistical area, a larger trade area, was 2,080,782, the 23rd-largest in the country. Indianapolis is considered a gamma global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85274,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T21:38:29.379509","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85274","category":"Person","slug":"peter-hassig","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/peter-hassig\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85274","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85274\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WLY","name":"Peter Hassig","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/peter-hassig\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":710,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","links":"","description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","category":"Topic","slug":"terrorism","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1542,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","geohash":"","daily_count":2,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","name":"terrorism","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1214,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fa\/United_States_Department_of_the_Army_Seal.svg","links":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States Army<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for land-based military operations.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":83044,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/12\/Dr._Anthony_Fauci.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Anthony Stephen Fauci<\/b> (born December 24, 1940) is an immunologist who has made substantial contributions to HIV\/AIDS research and other immunodeficiencies, both as a scientist and as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2014-09-17T15:43:17.479656","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthony_Fauci\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=83044","category":"Person","slug":"anthony-fauci","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthony_Fauci","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/anthony-fauci\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":2,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=83044","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/83044\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Vla","name":"Anthony Fauci","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/anthony-fauci\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","links":"","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion.

Health care is delivered by practitioners in allied health, dentistry, midwifery (obstetrics), medicine, nursing, optometry, pharmacy, psychology and other health professions. It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.<\/p>\n<p>Access to health care varies across countries, groups, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the health policies in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within their societies. Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of target populations. Their exact configuration varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately-paid workforce; reliable information on which to base decisions and policies; and well maintained health facilities and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Health care can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy. In 2011, the health care industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP-adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The USA (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The USA (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except Mexico and the USA. (see also international comparisons.)<\/p>\n<p>Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-06-15T21:40:13","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=188","category":"Topic","slug":"health-care","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care","recent_count":3,"local_url":"\/topic\/health-care\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1039,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=188","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/188\/","geohash":"","daily_count":3,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DC","name":"health care","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health-care\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":9203,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c8\/NIH_Master_Logo_Vertical_2Color.png","links":"","description":"<p><\/p>\n<p>The <b>National Institutes of Health<\/b> (<b>NIH<\/b>) is a biomedical research facility primarily located in Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","category":"Country","slug":"united-kingdom","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","woeid":23424975,"placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","item_count":6815,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","longitude":-2.23001,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","daily_count":9,"latitude":54.3141,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","name":"United Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":82666,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-09-14T14:16:45.437491","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=82666","category":"Person","slug":"alan-henning","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/alan-henning\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":8,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=82666","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/82666\/","geohash":"","daily_count":4,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/VfU","name":"Alan Henning","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/alan-henning\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":125,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/21\/David_Cameron_official.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>David William Donald Cameron<\/b> (\/ˈkæm(ə)rən\/; born 9 October 1966) is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party. He represents Witney as its Member of Parliament (MP).<\/p>\n<p>Cameron studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford, gaining a first-class honours degree in 1988. He was described by his tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, as \"one of the ablest\" students he has ever taught, with \"moderate and sensible Conservative\" political views. While at Oxford he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became Special Adviser to Norman Lamont, and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years.<\/p>\n<p>Cameron ran on a Eurosceptic platform in his first bid to enter Parliament, in Stafford in 1997, when he was defeated. He was elected in 2001 as the Member of Parliament for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later, and rose rapidly to become head of policy co-ordination during the 2005 general election campaign. With a public image of a youthful, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Conservative leadership election in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>In the 2010 United Kingdom general election held on 6 May, the Conservatives won 306 seats in a hung parliament. After five days of negotiation, Cameron formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems). Cameron leads the first coalition government of the United Kingdom since the Second World War. The 43-year-old Cameron became the youngest British Prime Minister since the Earl of Liverpool 198 years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Cameron's premiership has been marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis leading to a large deficit in government finances, which his government has emphasised the need to reduce through austerity measures. His administration has introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education and heathcare, by introducing the Welfare Reform Act of 2012, the Education Act of 2011, the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 and a range of immigration reforms from 2010 onwards, culminating in the Immigration Act of 2014. In 2011, Cameron became the first British Prime Minister to 'veto' an EU treaty. His government introduced a nationwide referendum on voting reform in 2011, a Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum in 2013, agreed a Scottish independence referendum, due to be held in September 2014, legalised same-sex marriages in England and Wales, met the United Nations target of spending at least 0.7% of GNI on aid to developing countries and promised an 'In\/Out' Referendum on the European Union in 2017, after a period of renegotiation, if the Conservatives are re-elected with an outright majority.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2010-05-07T13:56:33","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Cameron\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=125","category":"Person","slug":"david-cameron","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Cameron","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/david-cameron\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":921,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=125","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/125\/","geohash":"","daily_count":3,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CB","name":"David Cameron","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/david-cameron\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":52847,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/58\/Flag_of_the_Islamic_State.svg","links":"","description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":710,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","links":"","description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","category":"Topic","slug":"terrorism","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1542,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","geohash":"","daily_count":2,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","name":"terrorism","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>. Its natural reservoir is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans, through body fluids.<\/p>\n<p>The EBOV genome is approximately 19,000 base pairs long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA polymerase (L). It is difficult to study due to the virulent nature of the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its high mortality rate, EBOV is also listed a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a U.S. National Institutes of Health\/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, U.S. CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and listed as a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-07-31T16:42:57","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_virus\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=14434","category":"MedicalCondition","slug":"ebola-virus","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_virus","recent_count":14,"local_url":"\/topic\/ebola-virus\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":543,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=14434","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/14434\/","geohash":"","daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Duy","name":"Ebola virus","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ebola-virus\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":140,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Seal_of_the_Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States_2014.svg","links":"","description":"<p>The <b>Executive Office of the President<\/b> (<b>EOPOTUS<\/b> or <b>EOP<\/b>) consists of the immediate staff of the current President of the United States and multiple levels of support staff reporting to the President.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":66484,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/df\/El_viaxeru_d%27Urculo.JPG","links":"","description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

It is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in the state of California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose, and the 14th-most populous city in the United States—with a Census-estimated 2013 population of 837,442. The city is also the financial and cultural hub of the larger San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, with a population of 8.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>San Francisco (Spanish for \"Saint Francis\") was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established a fort at the Golden Gate and a mission named for St. Francis of Assisi a few miles away. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. Due to the growth of its population, San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. During World War II, San Francisco was the port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the \"hippie\" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>San Francisco is a popular tourist destination, known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former prison on Alcatraz Island, and its Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as the Gap Inc., Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, Twitter, Uber, Mozilla and Craigslist.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-06-04T22:16:31","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Francisco\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=755","category":"Town","slug":"san-francisco-ca-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Francisco","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/san-francisco-ca-us\/","woeid":2487956,"placetype":"Town","livevideo":"","item_count":1028,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=755","longitude":-122.439,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/755\/","geohash":"9q8yym2rz1rf","daily_count":1,"latitude":37.7474,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ML","name":"San Francisco, CA, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:05:48.759849","facebookchat":"off","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/san-francisco-ca-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":48587,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2013-11-01T21:58:45.544283","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=48587","category":"Subvertical","slug":"auto-travel","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Auto_travel","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/auto-travel\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":3599,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=48587","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/48587\/","geohash":"","daily_count":8,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Mnp","name":"auto travel","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:05:48.759849","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingtravel","kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/auto-travel\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":273,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/36\/Large_bonfire.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Fire<\/b> is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.

Fire has been used by humans for cooking, generating heat, light, signaling, and propulsion purposes. The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"fixed\" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-05-07T04:22:52","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=273","category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","slug":"fires","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/fires\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":7388,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=273","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/273\/","geohash":"","daily_count":10,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EZ","name":"fires","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fires\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":66484,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/df\/El_viaxeru_d%27Urculo.JPG","links":"","description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":11247,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/20\/Lisa_Monaco_--DOJ_Portrait--.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Lisa Oudens Monaco<\/b> (born February 25, 1968) is an American federal prosecutor who currently serves as the United States Homeland Security Advisor to President Barack Obama; the chief counterterrorism advisor to the President, and a statutory member of the United States Homeland Security Council.<\/p>\n<p>Monaco previously served as the Assistant Attorney General for National Security from 2011 to 2013, and as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2013-04-19T19:03:32","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lisa_Monaco\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=11247","category":"Person","slug":"lisa-monaco","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lisa_Monaco","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/lisa-monaco\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":8,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=11247","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/11247\/","geohash":"","daily_count":2,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C5Z","name":"Lisa Monaco","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:01:58.861380","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/lisa-monaco\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1396,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4c\/US_Department_of_Homeland_Security_Seal.svg","links":"","description":"<p>The <b>U.S. Department of Homeland Security<\/b> (<b>DHS<\/b>) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States and its territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. The Department of Homeland Security, and not the United States Department of the Interior, is equivalent to the Interior ministries of other countries. In fiscal year 2011, DHS was allocated a budget of $98.8 billion and spent, net, $66.4 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Where the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.<\/p>\n<p>With more than 200,000 employees, DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.<\/p>\n<p>On December 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as the Secretary of Homeland Security.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Homeland Security Research Corporation, the combined financial year 2010 state and local homeland security (HLS) markets, which employ more than 2.2 million first responders, totaled $16.5 billion, whereas the DHS HLS market totaled $13 billion. According to <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, \"DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010\".<\/p>\n<p>According to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War, and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-07-20T22:07:06","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1396","category":"Organization","slug":"united-states-department-of-homeland-security","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-homeland-security\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":191,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1396","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1396\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Wg","name":"United States Department of Homeland Security","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:01:58.861380","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-department-of-homeland-security\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","links":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","slug":"crime-courts","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","recent_count":11,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":43905,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","geohash":"","daily_count":31,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","links":"","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","links":"","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

Health care is delivered by practitioners in allied health, dentistry, midwifery (obstetrics), medicine, nursing, optometry, pharmacy, psychology and other health professions. It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.<\/p>\n<p>Access to health care varies across countries, groups, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the health policies in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within their societies. Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of target populations. Their exact configuration varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately-paid workforce; reliable information on which to base decisions and policies; and well maintained health facilities and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Health care can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy. In 2011, the health care industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP-adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The USA (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The USA (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except Mexico and the USA. (see also international comparisons.)<\/p>\n<p>Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-06-15T21:40:13","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=188","category":"Topic","slug":"health-care","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care","recent_count":3,"local_url":"\/topic\/health-care\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1039,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=188","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/188\/","geohash":"","daily_count":3,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DC","name":"health care","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health-care\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":67,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/86\/Smallpox_eradication_team.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

Health care is delivered by practitioners in allied health, dentistry, midwifery (obstetrics), medicine, nursing, optometry, pharmacy, psychology and other health professions. It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.<\/p>\n<p>Access to health care varies across countries, groups, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the health policies in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within their societies. Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of target populations. Their exact configuration varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately-paid workforce; reliable information on which to base decisions and policies; and well maintained health facilities and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Health care can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy. In 2011, the health care industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP-adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The USA (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The USA (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except Mexico and the USA. (see also international comparisons.)<\/p>\n<p>Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-06-15T21:40:13","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=188","category":"Topic","slug":"health-care","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_care","recent_count":3,"local_url":"\/topic\/health-care\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1039,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=188","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/188\/","geohash":"","daily_count":3,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DC","name":"health care","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health-care\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":5276,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/94\/Sylvia_Mathews_Burwell_official_portrait.jpg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Sylvia Mary Mathews Burwell<\/b> (born June 23, 1965) is an American politician who has been the 22nd United States Secretary of Health and Human Services since 2014.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}]},{"type":"text","status":"published","source":null,"whoas":7,"id":446866,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KMOV\/status\/518138556116512769","name":"KMOV","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491249705137872898\/bwfNyuJ6_normal.png","date":"2014-10-03T20:40:32","location":"St. Louis, MO","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518138556116512769","screen_name":"KMOV","id":249128,"user_id":"28390516","content":"Effective immediately the @stlcountypd will be taking over the security of all protests in #Ferguson at the request of the city's police."},"slug":"the-st-louis-county-mo-police-department-will","content":"The St. Louis County, Mo., police department will assume the security of all protests in Ferguson, Mo., at the request of the city's police - @KMOV","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/the-st-louis-county-mo-police-department-will","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 08:46 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vDHOwj","url_domain":"twitter.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446866\/","push_content":"The St. Louis County, Mo., police department will assume the security of all protests in Ferguson, Mo., at the request of the city's police - @KMOV","updated_date":"2014-10-03T20:46:25.741556","submitter":"editor","author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Pg","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KMOV\/status\/518138556116512769","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:46:22.556575","importance":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/the-st-louis-county-mo-police-department-will","topics":[{"id":75616,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-08-10T02:52:11.704750","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75616","category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","slug":"teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Brown_fatally_shot_in_Ferguson,_Mo.","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":647,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75616","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75616\/","geohash":"","daily_count":2,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Tpm","name":"Michael Brown fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo.","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:46:22.556575","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"arc","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":75615,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/St._Louis_County_Missouri_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Ferguson_Highlighted.svg","links":"","description":"<p><b>Ferguson<\/b> is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","links":"","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}]},{"type":"text","status":"published","source":null,"whoas":12,"id":446847,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCBreaking\/status\/518135879114948608","name":"BBC Breaking News","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460740982498013184\/wIPwMwru_normal.png","date":"2014-10-03T20:29:54","location":"London, UK","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518135879114948608","screen_name":"BBCBreaking","id":249118,"user_id":"5402612","content":"\"Major disturbance\" ongoing at Swaleside Prison where an officer has been stabbed, UK Prison Officers Association say http:\/\/t.co\/cRPOkT0NSv"},"slug":"major-disturbance-ongoing-at-swaleside-prison-wh","content":"'Major disturbance' ongoing at Swaleside Prison on the island of Sheppey, Kent, where an officer has been stabbed, UK Prison Officers Association say - @BBCBreaking","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/major-disturbance-ongoing-at-swaleside-prison-wh","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 08:33 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/1vDH2PH","url_domain":"bbc.co.uk","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446847\/","push_content":"'Major disturbance' ongoing at Swaleside Prison on the island of Sheppey, Kent, where an officer has been stabbed, UK Prison Officers Association say - @BBCBreaking","updated_date":"2014-10-03T20:39:09.242544","submitter":"feed","author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2PN","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-29485189","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:33:50.647220","importance":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/major-disturbance-ongoing-at-swaleside-prison-wh","topics":[{"id":43911,"image_url":"","links":"","description":"","created_on":"2013-09-05T08:04:49.534150","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43911","category":"Island","slug":"isle-of-sheppey-sheerness-england-gb","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/isle-of-sheppey-sheerness-england-gb\/","woeid":12480930,"placetype":"Island","livevideo":"","item_count":11,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43911","longitude":0.84133,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43911\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":51.3992,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LaP","name":"Isle of Sheppey, England, GB","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:33:50.647220","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/isle-of-sheppey-sheerness-england-gb\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","links":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P 500 Index, and the Russell 2000 Index, the Dow is among the most closely watched U.S. benchmark indices tracking targeted stock market activity. Components of the Dow trade on both the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. Derivatives of the Dow trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and through the CME Group, the world's largest futures exchange company. CME Group owns 24.4% of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the Industrial Average.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-06-10T20:29:04","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=12","category":"MarketIndex","slug":"dow-30","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/dow-30\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":1274,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=12","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/12\/","geohash":"","daily_count":4,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/M","name":"Dow Jones Industrial Average","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:29:58.129875","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dow-30\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":43390,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d7\/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","links":"","description":"<p>A <b>market<\/b> is one of the many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange. While parties may exchange goods and services by barter, most markets rely on sellers offering their goods or services (including labor) in exchange for money from buyers. It can be said that a market is the process by which the prices of goods and services are established.<\/p>\n<p>For a market to be competitive, there must be more than a single buyer or seller. It has been suggested that two people may trade, but it takes at least three persons to have a market, so that there is competition in at least one of its two sides. However, <i>competitive<\/i> markets, as understood in formal economic theory, rely on much larger numbers of both buyers and sellers. A market with a single seller and multiple buyers is a monopoly. A market with a single buyer and multiple sellers is a monopsony. These are the extremes of imperfect competition.<\/p>\n<p>Markets vary in form, scale (volume and geographic reach), location, and types of participants, as well as the types of goods and services traded. Examples include:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Physical retail markets, such as local public markets, farmers' markets, street markets, flea markets, bazaars, and other public marketplaces; shopping centers and shopping malls<\/li>\n<li>Physical wholesale markets<\/li>\n<li>(Non-physical) Internet markets (see electronic commerce)<\/li>\n<li>Ad hoc auction markets<\/li>\n<li>Markets for intermediate goods used in production of other goods and services<\/li>\n<li>Labor markets<\/li>\n<li>International currency and commodity markets<\/li>\n<li>Stock markets, for the exchange of shares in corporations<\/li>\n<li>Artificial markets created by regulation to exchange rights for derivatives that have been designed to ameliorate externalities, such as pollution permits (see carbon trading)<\/li>\n<li>Illegal markets such as the market for illicit drugs, arms or pirated products<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>In mainstream economics, the concept of a <b>market<\/b> is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The exchange of goods or services for money is a transaction. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its price. This influence is a major study of economics and has given rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and demand. There are two roles in markets, buyers and sellers. The market facilitates trade and enables the distribution and allocation of resources in a society. Markets allow any trade-able item to be evaluated and priced. A market emerges more or less spontaneously or may be constructed deliberately by human interaction in order to enable the exchange of rights (cf. ownership) of services and goods.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-08-28T00:33:24.320160","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Market_(economics)\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43390","category":"Subvertical","slug":"markets","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Market_(economics)","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/markets\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":2292,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43390","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43390\/","geohash":"","daily_count":5,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LR0","name":"markets","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:29:58.129875","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/markets\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":7,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg","links":"","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is sometimes referred to as <b>marriage equality<\/b> or <b>equal marriage<\/b>, particularly by supporters. The legalization of same-sex marriage is characterized as \"redefining marriage\" by many opponents.<\/p>\n<p>The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. As of 28 June 2014, sixteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, Uruguay) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of Mexico and the United States) allow same-sex couples to marry. The law in Luxembourg will come into force on 1 January 2015. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status.<\/p>\n\n<p>Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via a ballot initiative or a referendum). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, human rights and civil rights issue, as well as a religious issue in many nations and around the world, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, or instead be allowed to hold a different status (a civil union), or be denied such rights. Same-sex marriage can provide same-sex couples who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of opposite-sex married couples. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.<\/p>\n<p>Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex couples benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions. Court documents filed by American scientific associations also state that singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them. The American Anthropological Association avers that social science research does not support the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon not recognizing same-sex marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting. Various faith communities around the world support allowing same-sex couples to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: Buddhism in Australia, Church of Sweden, Conservative Judaism, U.S. Episcopalians, Humanistic Judaism, Native American religions with a two-spirit tradition, Druids, the Metropolitan Community Church, Quakers, Reconstructionist Judaism, Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalists, the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, and Wiccans, as well as various other progressive and modern Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish groups and various minor religions and other denominations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-04T22:04:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Same-sex_marriage\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=115","category":"Topic","slug":"same-sex-marriage","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Same-sex_marriage","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/same-sex-marriage\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":812,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=115","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/115\/","geohash":"","daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B1","name":"same-sex marriage","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:21:33.529556","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"tag","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/same-sex-marriage\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","links":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"location","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","links":"","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>. Its natural reservoir is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans, through body fluids.<\/p>\n<p>The EBOV genome is approximately 19,000 base pairs long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA polymerase (L).

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","livevideo":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"kind":"vertical","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}]}]}

The city is referred to as <b>New York City<\/b> or the <b>City of New York<\/b> to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part. A global power city, New York exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. The home of the United Nations Headquarters, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>On one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a county of New York State. The five boroughs—the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a census-estimated 2013 population of 8,405,837 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2013 census estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (19.9 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.5 million residents). In 2012, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of over US$1.33 trillion, while the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve nations and eleven nations, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known to the city's approximately 55 million annual visitors. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconified as \"The Crossroads of the World\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. New York City's financial district, anchored by Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, has been called the world's leading financial center and is home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by total market capitalization of its listed companies. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 468 stations in operation. New York City's higher education network comprises over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-06-04T15:19:28","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=134","category":"Town","slug":"new-york-ny-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","woeid":2459115,"placetype":"Town","item_count":5182,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=134","longitude":-74.0071,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/134\/","geohash":"dr5regvetxd9","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":3,"latitude":40.7146,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CK","name":"New York, NY, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:03:11.221280","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1265,"image_url":"","description":"<p>A <b>bomb threat<\/b> is generally defined as a threat, usually verbal or written, to detonate an explosive or incendiary device to cause property damage, death, or injuries, whether or not such a device actually exists.<\/p>\n<p>Criminal statutes typically dictate severe penalties.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","category":"Topic","slug":"weather","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":24916,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","name":"weather","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:26:23.330263","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2HT","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MeghanDanahey\/status\/517792970129420288\/photo\/1","data":null,"date":"2014-10-02T22:01:56.193954","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/02\/photo-a-severe-weather-storm-from-in-sauget-ill","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":57,"id":446807,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WJACTV\/status\/518122417995382785","name":"6 News","id":249167,"date":"2014-10-03T19:36:25","location":"West-Central Pennsylvania","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518122417995382785","screen_name":"WJACTV","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1610843194\/6_news_logo-twitter_normal.jpg","user_id":"36971022","content":"Fire crews are being dispatched to the Flight 93 Memorial visitors center.

Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Fire has been used by humans for cooking, generating heat, light, signaling, and propulsion purposes. The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"fixed\" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-05-07T04:22:52","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=273","category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","slug":"fires","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/fires\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":7388,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=273","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/273\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":10,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EZ","name":"fires","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fires\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Oj","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WJACTV\/status\/518122417995382785\/photo\/1","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:00:27.884870","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-fire-crews-are-being-dispatched-to-the-flig","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":42,"id":446424,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/myfoxla\/status\/517839985181872129","name":"FOX 11 Los Angeles","id":248742,"date":"2014-10-03T00:54:08","location":"Los Angeles, CA","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"517839985181872129","screen_name":"myfoxla","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000408294489\/f9eadad3dca877d25cbf13cc034b8c02_normal.jpeg","user_id":"9648652","content":"#BREAKING: Technical problem reported on Mickey's Fun Wheel at California Adventure, a 160-foot ferris wheel. http:\/\/t.co\/T6xLf9kFFu"},"slug":"breaking-technical-problem-reported-on-mickeys","content":"Photo: Technical problem reported on Mickey's Fun Wheel at California Adventure park in Anaheim, Calif. - @myfoxla","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/breaking-technical-problem-reported-on-mickeys","note":null,"media":{"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/By-8uOsIQAEvpbF.jpg","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/myfoxla\/status\/517839985181872129\/photo\/1","width":640,"author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/myfoxla","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"FOX 11 Los Angeles","id":50645,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/By-8uOsIQAEvpbF.jpg:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":360,"title":"#BREAKING: Technical problem reported on Mickey's Fun Wheel at California Adventure, a 160-foot ferris wheel. http:\/\/t.co\/T6xLf9kFFu","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 12:55 AM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1yBdYfs","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446424\/","push_content":"Photo: Technical problem reported on Mickey's Fun Wheel at California Adventure park in Anaheim, Calif. - @myfoxla","updated_date":"2014-10-03T00:58:50.027641","submitter":"partner","topics":[{"id":38881,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2013-06-28T07:22:55.650091","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=38881","category":"POI","slug":"california-adventure-park-anaheim-ca-us","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/california-adventure-park-anaheim-ca-us\/","woeid":23533683,"placetype":"POI","item_count":3,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=38881","primary":true,"longitude":-117.914,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/38881\/","geohash":"9qh0kdk8999r","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":2,"latitude":33.7998,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/KHH","name":"California Adventure Park, Anaheim, CA, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T01:05:04.606039","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/california-adventure-park-anaheim-ca-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":4026,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/21\/Flag_of_Anaheim%2C_California.png","description":"<p><b>Anaheim<\/b> (pronounced \/ˈænəhaɪm\/) is a city located in Orange County, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes also loosely applied to the whole state), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","category":"Country","slug":"united-kingdom","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","woeid":23424975,"placetype":"Country","item_count":6815,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","longitude":-2.23001,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":9,"latitude":54.3141,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","name":"United Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":52847,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/58\/Flag_of_the_Islamic_State.svg","description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":19619,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a1\/John_Cantlie.jpg","description":"<p><b>John Cantlie<\/b> is a British war photographer and correspondent who was kidnapped by British Islamic extremists while crossing into Syria on July 19, 2012, near Bab al Hawa. Along with Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlemans, Cantlie was shot while trying to escape their captors. In an interview with The Sun newspaper on 26 August 2012 Cantlie said it was <i>\"every Englishman's duty to try and escape if captured.\"<\/i> Both photographers claimed they were about to be handed over to a jihad unit affiliated with al-Qaeda for ransom when they were rescued by the Free Syrian Army. Cantlie's kidnap is the first recorded case of a British journalist being held, shot and then rescued from fellow Britons during the revolutions of the Arab Spring.<\/p>\n<p>The pair were held by the jihad group <i>al-Dawla al-Islamiyya<\/i> (The Islamic State) whose leader, Abo Mohamad Al-Shami, encouraged British Muslims to join the group to fight a Holy War against the government of Bashar al-Assad. It is alleged the group used the cover of online aid agencies to smuggle European fighters across the Turkish border into Syria. In an account in The Sunday Times on 5 August 2012, Cantlie wrote: <i>\"I ended up running for my life, barefoot and handcuffed, while British jihadists - young men with south London accents - shot to kill. They were aiming their Kalashnikovs at a British journalist, Londoner against Londoner in a rocky landscape that looked like the Scottish Highlands. Bullets kicking up dirt as I ran. A bullet through my arm, another grazing my ear. And not a Syrian in sight. This wasn't what I had expected.\"<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Oerlemans was shot in the left leg and Cantlie in the left arm during their escape attempt, Cantlie suffering ulnar nerve palsy (loss of feeling and use to the hand) as a result. In an account of the shooting, Oerlemans says some of the British Muslims stood over him holding a rock as though to smash it onto his head and shouted, <i>\"die, kaffir, die!\"<\/i> Oerlemans then stated that <i>\"the British guys were the most vindictive of them all.\"<\/i> They were taken back to the camp where a fighter who claimed to be an NHS doctor stabilized them and treated their wounds. The pair said the doctor gave them information and extra food. Cantlie later wrote in the October 2012 edition of FHM magazine that this was Stockholm Syndrome, where a hostage befriends one or more of their captors.<\/p>\n<p>They were subjected to mock executions, beaten and at one point believed they would be beheaded when their captors started sharpening knives. <i>\"I honestly thought that was it,\"<\/i> Cantlie wrote in The Sunday Times. Then on 26 July, one week after being kidnapped, they were rescued by four members of the FSA. The rebels came into the camp shooting their weapons and held at least one jihad fighter at gunpoint while Cantlie and Oerlemans were helped into a waiting vehicle. Both photographers had to be assisted as their feet had been seriously injured when they tried to escape and neither could walk. They had lost all their camera equipment, passports and clothes in the incident, and were smuggled back across the border at a crossing used primarily by Syrian refugees. They were initially treated by a medic for the New York Times in Antakya before being debriefed by Turkish and then British intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>One month later Abo Mohamad Al-Shami was killed in unclear circumstances, reportedly by an officer in the Farouq Brigades, a rival jihad group. Reports say he was kidnapped by the unit, held for three days and then executed by repeated stabbing in the stomach. His body was recovered and buried by his brother in the area near to the Syrian town of Samarda. There were unconfirmed reports of British special forces operating in the area at the same time, while the members of <i>al-Dawla al-Islamiyya<\/i> headed south for Homs or left Syria soon afterwards. On 9 October 2012 an individual suspected of being involved in the kidnap was arrested at Heathrow airport after arriving on a flight from Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>This was Cantlie's second visit to Syria. In March 2012 he became the first Western photographer to witness first-hand an incursion by government ground troops into a city when T72 heavy tanks rolled into the city of Saraquib in Idlib province and started shelling indiscriminately. In a feature in the Sunday Telegraph published on March 31, Cantlie wrote: <i>\"Then the tanks opened fire. Fist-sized pieces of shrapnel sliced through the air, decapitating one rebel immediately. His rifle clattered to the ground as his friends dragged his headless torso from the line of fire.\"<\/i> To illustrate what the Syrian rebels were up against, Cantlie took a photograph looking down the barrel of an advancing T72. In an interview he later described taking the picture as <i>\"not terribly comfortable.\"<\/i><\/p>\n<p>John Cantlie is the great grandson of Dr James Cantlie, who in 1896 was instrumental in the protection of the famous Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat Sen who would otherwise have been executed by the Chinese secret service. His grandfather, Colonel Kenneth Cantlie, designed the China Railways KF locomotive, at 260 tons the largest locomotive of post-war China that remained in service until 1972.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2014 Cantlie's whereabouts are unknown. He has not appeared in print or on social media since late 2012 and the trial against one of his alleged captors collapsed in 2013 when he could not be summoned as a witness.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","category":"Topic","slug":"war-conflict","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":25716,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","name":"war & conflict","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","last_name":"McDermott","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","first_name":"Tricia","id":23,"username":"tricia.mcdermott"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2MG","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-29480694","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T14:44:44.409367","url_domain":"bbc.co.uk","importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-father-of-british-hostage-john-cantlie-make","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":33,"id":446724,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cnnbrk\/status\/518084481224556544","name":"CNN Breaking News","id":248977,"date":"2014-10-03T17:05:40","location":"Everywhere","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518084481224556544","screen_name":"cnnbrk","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1762504301\/128x128_cnnbrk_avatar_normal.gif","user_id":"428333","content":"RT @devonmsayers: Private hazmat cleaning company arriving at complex were man with Ebola in Dallas was staying http:\/\/t.co\/3lZ22TIuMy"},"slug":"rt-devonmsayers-private-hazmat-cleaning-company","content":"Photo: Private hazmat cleaning company arriving at complex were man with Ebola in Dallas was staying - @devonmsayers","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/rt-devonmsayers-private-hazmat-cleaning-company","note":null,"media":{"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzCZ2JnCUAEU4AA.jpg","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devonmsayers\/status\/518083114917457920\/photo\/1","width":1024,"author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cnnbrk","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"CNN Breaking News","id":50704,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzCZ2JnCUAEU4AA.jpg:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":768,"title":"RT @devonmsayers: Private hazmat cleaning company arriving at complex were man with Ebola in Dallas was staying http:\/\/t.co\/3lZ22TIuMy","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 05:06 PM GMT","shortened_url":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446724\/","push_content":"Photo: Private hazmat cleaning company arriving at complex were man with Ebola in Dallas was staying - @devonmsayers","updated_date":"2014-10-03T17:08:33.144005","submitter":"feed","topics":[{"id":60148,"image_url":"","description":"Africa’s biggest Ebola outbreak in seven years is impacting people in Guinea and has likely spread to neighboring Liberia and is threatening Sierra Leone. - Bloomberg News","created_on":"2014-03-24T18:26:05.941250","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=60148","category":"HealthEvent","slug":"africa-ebola-outbreak-2014","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_outbreak_2014","recent_count":14,"local_url":"\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":530,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=60148","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/60148\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PoI","name":"Ebola outbreak 2014","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"arc","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1421,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/3\/36\/Dallas_Montage_2014.png","description":"<p><b>Dallas<\/b> \/ˈdæləs\/ is a major city in Texas and along with Fort Worth, is one of the two urban centers of a metropolitan area that ranks fourth in the United States. The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"aaron.edwards@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Edwards","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/17\/","first_name":"Aaron","id":17,"username":"aaron.edwards"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2NO","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cnnbrk\/status\/518084481224556544","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T17:06:36.900094","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/rt-devonmsayers-private-hazmat-cleaning-company","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":30,"id":446583,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Alex_Ogle\/status\/518002222693490688","name":"Alex Ogle","id":248863,"date":"2014-10-03T11:38:48","location":"Hong Kong","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518002222693490688","screen_name":"Alex_Ogle","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/416362326070030336\/dnm8M0IT_normal.jpeg","user_id":"26957009","content":"Group of men in masks beat up a man who tried stop them removing fences from democracy protest in Hong Kong @AFPphoto http:\/\/t.co\/ypmsRa2VYn"},"slug":"photo-a-group-of-men-in-masks-attack-a-man-who-re","content":"Photo: A group of men in masks attacks a man who reportedly tried stop them removing fences from democracy protest in Hong Kong - @Alex_Ogle","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-a-group-of-men-in-masks-attack-a-man-who-re","note":null,"media":{"url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzBQRgYCEAAGKjB.jpg:large","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Alex_Ogle\/status\/518002222693490688","width":1024,"author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Alex_Ogle","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"Alex_Ogle","id":50673,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzBQRgYCEAAGKjB.jpg:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":689,"title":"Alex Ogle on Twitter: \"Group of men in masks beat up a man who tried stop them removing fences from democracy protest in Hong Kong @AFPphoto http:\/\/t.co\/ypmsRa2VYn\"","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 12:02 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1uGREP2","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446583\/","push_content":"Photo: A group of men in masks attack a man who reportedly tried stop them removing fences from democracy protest in Hong Kong - @Alex_Ogle","updated_date":"2014-10-03T12:10:03.805553","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":71416,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/2\/25\/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace_logo.jpg","description":"<p><b>Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP)<\/b> is a nonviolent occupation protest for universal suffrage in Central, Hong Kong that started on 27 September 2014.

Hong Kong is known for its expansive skyline and deep natural harbour, and with a land mass of 1,104 km<sup>2<\/sup> (426 sq mi) and a population of over seven million people, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Hong Kong's population is 93.6% ethnic Chinese and 6.4% from other groups. Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking majority originate mainly from the neighbouring Canton (now Guangdong) province, from which many of them fled to escape wars and communist rule in China from the 1930s to the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42). Hong Kong Island was first ceded to the UK in perpetuity, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories was put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during the Pacific War (1941–45), after which the British resumed control until 1997. The region espoused minimum government intervention under the ethos of positive non-interventionism during the colonial era. The time period greatly influenced the current culture of Hong Kong, often described as \"East meets West\", and the educational system, which used to loosely follow the system in England until reforms implemented in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" (the other, Macau, attained that status in December 1999). It has a different political system from mainland China. Hong Kong's independent judiciary functions under the common law framework. The Hong Kong Basic Law (its constitutional document) governs its political system, and stipulates that Hong Kong shall have a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and military defence. Although it has a burgeoning multi-party system, a small-circle electorate controls half of its legislature, which led to it being classified a semi-authoritarian regime with highly suppressed political rights. The head of the government, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, is chosen by an Election Committee of 400 to 1,200 members, a situation that will be in effect during the first 20 years of Chinese rule.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a world city and is one of the Al­pha+ cities. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world's most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world but also the highest income inequality among advanced economies. The dense space has also led to a highly developed transportation network with the public transport travelling rate exceeding 90 percent, the highest in the world. Hong Kong has numerous high international rankings in various aspects, such as its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, Human Development Index are all ranked highly. According to estimates from both UN and WHO, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world in 2012.

It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood.<\/p>\n<p>Nicknamed the <i>City of Angels<\/i>, Los Angeles is a global city, with strengths in business, international trade, entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine and research and has been ranked sixth in the Global Cities Index and 9th Global Economic Power Index. The city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area (CSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (as of 2008), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas. Los Angeles includes Hollywood and leads the world in the creation of television productions, video games, and recorded music; it is also one of the leaders in motion picture production.

The European Union (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering by water of land not normally covered by water. In the sense of \"flowing water\", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river or lake, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.<\/p>\n<p>Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.<\/p>\n<p>Some floods develop slowly, while others such as flash floods, can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighbourhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:45:23","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flood\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=159","category":"WeatherEvent","slug":"floods","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flood","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/floods\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":3225,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=159","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/159\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cj","name":"floods","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T01:32:02.795647","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/floods\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":66484,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/df\/El_viaxeru_d%27Urculo.JPG","description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","category":"Topic","slug":"weather","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":24916,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","name":"weather","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:26:23.330263","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Stampher","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","first_name":"Jillian","id":14,"username":"jillian.stamper"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Iu","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/myfoxla\/status\/517849374471495680\/photo\/1","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T01:32:02.795647","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/breaking-there-is-a-water-main-break-in-park-la","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":26,"id":446388,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ewalk51\/status\/517809101917913089","name":"Eric Walker","id":248716,"date":"2014-10-02T22:51:24","location":"","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"517809101917913089","screen_name":"ewalk51","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/496046281538564097\/1XmjXRj__normal.jpeg","user_id":"2704966687","content":"Trees down in arlington near woodland west park @JimCantore @weatherchannel http:\/\/t.co\/4jJDitToNi"},"slug":"photo-trees-downed-in-park-in-arlington-texas-a","content":"Photo: Trees downed in park in Arlington, Texas, as storms move through area - @ewalk51","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/02\/photo-trees-downed-in-park-in-arlington-texas-a","note":null,"media":{"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/By-gnhgIUAE3W4s.jpg","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ewalk51\/status\/517809101917913089\/photo\/1","width":1024,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ewalk51","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"Eric Walker","id":50639,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/By-gnhgIUAE3W4s.jpg:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":576,"title":"Trees down in arlington near woodland west park @JimCantore @weatherchannel http:\/\/t.co\/4jJDitToNi","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 02, 2014, 11:26 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vyMHov","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446388\/","push_content":"Photo: Trees downed in park in Arlington, Texas, as storms move through area - @ewalk51","updated_date":"2014-10-02T23:26:25.946369","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":85144,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-02T21:45:29.043142","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85144","category":"","slug":"north-texas-storms-oct-2-2014","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/north-texas-storms-oct-2-2014\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":16,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85144","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85144\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":16,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WJS","name":"North Texas storms, Oct. 2, 2014","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T05:39:27.223347","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"arc","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-texas-storms-oct-2-2014\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":10851,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a4\/ArlingtonTXMontage1.png","description":"<p><b>Arlington<\/b> is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, within the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area and Tarrant County.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2OO","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dallaspiosana\/status\/518118709937053697\/photo\/1","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T19:24:10.503169","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-a-hazmat-team-at-the-dallas-apartment-of-eb","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":23,"id":446688,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomgrundy\/status\/518066574373044224","name":"Tom Grundy","id":248943,"date":"2014-10-03T15:54:31","location":"Hong Kong","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518066574373044224","screen_name":"tomgrundy","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509497024106856449\/Kr0B0cBT_normal.jpeg","user_id":"74418756","content":"Mongkok #Occupycentral http:\/\/t.co\/JVQi2O39Uc"},"slug":"photo-view-over-protester-crowd-in-mong-kok-hong","content":"Photo: View over protester crowd in Mong Kok, Hong Kong - @tomgrundy","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-view-over-protester-crowd-in-mong-kok-hong","note":null,"media":{"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzCKwIuCEAAiZbf.jpg","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomgrundy\/status\/518066574373044224\/photo\/1","width":1024,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomgrundy","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"Tom Grundy","id":50696,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzCKwIuCEAAiZbf.jpg:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":768,"title":"Mongkok #Occupycentral http:\/\/t.co\/JVQi2O39Uc","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 04:02 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vkeNDo","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446688\/","push_content":"Photo: View over protester crowd in Mong Kok, Hong Kong - @tomgrundy","updated_date":"2014-10-03T16:02:19.176972","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":71416,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/2\/25\/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace_logo.jpg","description":"<p><b>Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP)<\/b> is a nonviolent occupation protest for universal suffrage in Central, Hong Kong that started on 27 September 2014.

Hong Kong is known for its expansive skyline and deep natural harbour, and with a land mass of 1,104 km<sup>2<\/sup> (426 sq mi) and a population of over seven million people, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Hong Kong's population is 93.6% ethnic Chinese and 6.4% from other groups. Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking majority originate mainly from the neighbouring Canton (now Guangdong) province, from which many of them fled to escape wars and communist rule in China from the 1930s to the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42). Hong Kong Island was first ceded to the UK in perpetuity, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories was put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during the Pacific War (1941–45), after which the British resumed control until 1997. The region espoused minimum government intervention under the ethos of positive non-interventionism during the colonial era. The time period greatly influenced the current culture of Hong Kong, often described as \"East meets West\", and the educational system, which used to loosely follow the system in England until reforms implemented in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" (the other, Macau, attained that status in December 1999). It has a different political system from mainland China. Hong Kong's independent judiciary functions under the common law framework. The Hong Kong Basic Law (its constitutional document) governs its political system, and stipulates that Hong Kong shall have a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and military defence. Although it has a burgeoning multi-party system, a small-circle electorate controls half of its legislature, which led to it being classified a semi-authoritarian regime with highly suppressed political rights. The head of the government, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, is chosen by an Election Committee of 400 to 1,200 members, a situation that will be in effect during the first 20 years of Chinese rule.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a world city and is one of the Al­pha+ cities. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world's most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world but also the highest income inequality among advanced economies. The dense space has also led to a highly developed transportation network with the public transport travelling rate exceeding 90 percent, the highest in the world. Hong Kong has numerous high international rankings in various aspects, such as its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, Human Development Index are all ranked highly. According to estimates from both UN and WHO, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world in 2012. However, air pollution and smog is a serious problem with loose emission standards and high level of carcinogenic PM2.5 compared to other advanced economies.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-04-21T00:23:01","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=952","category":"Country","slug":"hong-kong","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/hong-kong\/","woeid":24865698,"placetype":"Country","item_count":665,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=952","longitude":114.154,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/952\/","geohash":"wecpmxu6syrz","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":24,"latitude":22.4112,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PW","name":"Hong Kong","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T19:10:08.268684","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hong-kong\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":84485,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-09-29T08:08:40.561825","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=84485","category":"Town","slug":"mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk\/","woeid":24702932,"placetype":"Town","item_count":15,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=84485","longitude":114.169,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/84485\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":11,"latitude":22.3206,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/V8p","name":"Mong Kok, Yau Tsim Mong, HK","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T18:26:54.471840","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":307,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e0\/Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg","description":"<p>A <b>protest<\/b> (also called a <b>remonstrance<\/b> or a <b>remonstration<\/b>) is an expression of objection by words or by actions to particular events, policies, or situations.

Its capital Damascus is among the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, it is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including the majority Arab population, Alawite, Druze, Sunni and Christian. Other ethnic groups includes; Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Yezidi and Turks. Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria.<\/p>\n<p>In English, the name \"Syria\" was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as <i>al-Sham<\/i>) while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the third millennium BC. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>The modern Syrian state was established after World War I as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–1971. Between 1958-61, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is considered to be non-democratic. Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was in office from 1970 to 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Syria is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement; it is currently suspended from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in civil war in the wake of uprisings (considered an extension of the Arab Spring, the mass movement of revolutions and protests in the Arab world) against Assad and the Ba'athist government. An alternative government was formed by the opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, in March 2012. Representatives of this government were subsequently invited to take up Syria's seat at the Arab League.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-06-18T19:03:20","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Syria\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52","category":"Country","slug":"syria","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Syria","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/syria\/","woeid":23424956,"placetype":"Country","item_count":6798,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52","longitude":39.056,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52\/","geohash":"sy5y09zdyv07","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":4,"latitude":34.8148,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/0","name":"Syria","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T18:40:05.001454","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/syria\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":467,"image_url":"","description":"<p><b>Turkey<\/b> (\/ˈtɜr.ki\/; Turkish: <i>Türkiye<\/i>, <small>pronounced <\/small>[tyrkije]), officially the <b>Republic of Turkey<\/b> (Turkish: <i>Türkiye Cumhuriyeti<\/i>, <small>pronounced <\/small>[tyrkije d͡ʒumhurijeti]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), is a contiguous transcontinental parliamentary republic, with its smaller part in Southeastern Europe and its larger part in Western Asia (i.e. the Balkans and Anatolia, respectively). Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Bulgaria to the northwest; Greece to the west; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The Mediterranean Sea is to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and the Black Sea to the north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant geostrategic importance.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic age, including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations, Aeolian and Ionian Greeks, Thracians and Persians. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized, which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was greatly accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, upon which it disintegrated into several small Turkish beyliks.<\/p>\n<p>Starting from the late 13th century, the Ottomans united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period. The empire reached the peak of its power between the 15th and 17th centuries, especially during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566). After the second Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683 and the end of the Great Turkish War in 1699, the Ottoman Empire entered a long period of decline. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which aimed to modernize the Ottoman state, proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I (1914–1918) on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated. During the war, major atrocities were committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks. Following WWI, the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states. The Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922), initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues in Anatolia, resulted in the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage. The country's official language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by approximately 85% of the population. About three quarters of the population are ethnic Turks and about a fifth ethnic Kurds. The vast majority of the population is Muslim. Turkey is a member state of the Council of Europe, NATO, OECD, OSCE and the G-20 major economies. Turkey began full membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005, having been an associate member of the European Economic Community since 1963 and having joined the EU Customs Union in 1995. Turkey is also a member of the Turkic Council, Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization. Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:41:28","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=467","category":"Country","slug":"turkey","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/turkey\/","woeid":23424969,"placetype":"Country","item_count":1517,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=467","longitude":35.4317,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/467\/","geohash":"sycjwk0943wk","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":2,"latitude":38.9577,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hh","name":"Turkey","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T18:40:05.001454","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/turkey\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":52847,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/58\/Flag_of_the_Islamic_State.svg","description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

Hong Kong is known for its expansive skyline and deep natural harbour, and with a land mass of 1,104 km<sup>2<\/sup> (426 sq mi) and a population of over seven million people, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Hong Kong's population is 93.6% ethnic Chinese and 6.4% from other groups. Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking majority originate mainly from the neighbouring Canton (now Guangdong) province, from which many of them fled to escape wars and communist rule in China from the 1930s to the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42). Hong Kong Island was first ceded to the UK in perpetuity, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories was put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during the Pacific War (1941–45), after which the British resumed control until 1997. The region espoused minimum government intervention under the ethos of positive non-interventionism during the colonial era. The time period greatly influenced the current culture of Hong Kong, often described as \"East meets West\", and the educational system, which used to loosely follow the system in England until reforms implemented in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" (the other, Macau, attained that status in December 1999). It has a different political system from mainland China. Hong Kong's independent judiciary functions under the common law framework. The Hong Kong Basic Law (its constitutional document) governs its political system, and stipulates that Hong Kong shall have a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and military defence. Although it has a burgeoning multi-party system, a small-circle electorate controls half of its legislature, which led to it being classified a semi-authoritarian regime with highly suppressed political rights. The head of the government, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, is chosen by an Election Committee of 400 to 1,200 members, a situation that will be in effect during the first 20 years of Chinese rule.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a world city and is one of the Al­pha+ cities. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world's most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world but also the highest income inequality among advanced economies. The dense space has also led to a highly developed transportation network with the public transport travelling rate exceeding 90 percent, the highest in the world. Hong Kong has numerous high international rankings in various aspects, such as its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, Human Development Index are all ranked highly. According to estimates from both UN and WHO, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world in 2012. However, air pollution and smog is a serious problem with loose emission standards and high level of carcinogenic PM2.5 compared to other advanced economies.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-04-21T00:23:01","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=952","category":"Country","slug":"hong-kong","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/hong-kong\/","woeid":24865698,"placetype":"Country","item_count":665,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=952","longitude":114.154,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/952\/","geohash":"wecpmxu6syrz","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":24,"latitude":22.4112,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PW","name":"Hong Kong","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T19:10:08.268684","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hong-kong\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":84485,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-09-29T08:08:40.561825","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=84485","category":"Town","slug":"mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk\/","woeid":24702932,"placetype":"Town","item_count":15,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=84485","longitude":114.169,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/84485\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":11,"latitude":22.3206,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/V8p","name":"Mong Kok, Yau Tsim Mong, HK","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T18:26:54.471840","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mong-kok-yau-tsim-mong-hk\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":48587,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2013-11-01T21:58:45.544283","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=48587","category":"Subvertical","slug":"auto-travel","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Auto_travel","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/auto-travel\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":3599,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=48587","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/48587\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":"breakingtravel","daily_count":8,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Mnp","name":"auto travel","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:05:48.759849","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/auto-travel\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":307,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e0\/Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg","description":"<p>A <b>protest<\/b> (also called a <b>remonstrance<\/b> or a <b>remonstration<\/b>) is an expression of objection by words or by actions to particular events, policies, or situations.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","category":"Topic","slug":"weather","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":24916,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","name":"weather","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:26:23.330263","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Stampher","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","first_name":"Jillian","id":14,"username":"jillian.stamper"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2IX","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RobDeputy\/status\/517838632355635200","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T00:54:32.475713","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-storm-damage-seen-in-waco-texas-robdepu","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":16,"id":446644,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nytimes\/status\/518043307075981312","name":"The New York Times","id":248905,"date":"2014-10-03T14:22:03","location":"New York City","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518043307075981312","screen_name":"nytimes","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2044921128\/finals_normal.png","user_id":"807095","content":"Jobs gains may be too late to help Democrats in the elections http:\/\/t.co\/jsjk41whUY http:\/\/t.co\/n7jqeQNLFX"},"slug":"graph-progression-of-us-job-creation-and-unemploy","content":"Graph: Progression of US job creation and unemployment rate in recent years leading up to September - @nytimes","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/graph-progression-of-us-job-creation-and-unemploy","note":null,"media":{"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzB1pJZIgAEWaF7.png","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","type":"photo","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nytimes\/status\/518043307075981312\/photo\/1","width":712,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nytimes","resource_uri":"","html":"","author_name":"The New York Times","id":50682,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/BzB1pJZIgAEWaF7.png:thumb","thumbnail_width":150,"height":272,"title":"Jobs gains may be too late to help Democrats in the elections http:\/\/t.co\/jsjk41whUY http:\/\/t.co\/n7jqeQNLFX","provider_name":"Twitter"},"pushed":false,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 02:24 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1pLMF7Y","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446644\/","push_content":"Graph: Progression of US job creation and unemployment rate in recent years leading up to September - @nytimes","updated_date":"2014-10-03T14:24:56.601402","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":43417,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/59\/World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg","description":"<p>An <b>economic indicator<\/b> is a statistic about an economic activity.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":43416,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/59\/World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg","description":"<p>An <b>economic indicator<\/b> is a statistic about an economic activity.

The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate. According to International Labour Organization report, more than 197 million people globally are out of work or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>There remains considerable theoretical debate regarding the causes, consequences and solutions for unemployment. Classical economics, New classical economics, and the Austrian School of economics argue that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment. These theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside, such as unionization, bureaucratic work rules, minimum wage laws, taxes, and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers.<\/p>\n<p>Keynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions. This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers. Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers; these can include financial stimuli, publicly funded job creation, and expansionist monetary policies. Keynes believed that the root cause of unemployment is the desire of investors to receive more money rather than produce more products, which is not possible without public bodies producing new money.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment, there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system. The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization. Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates. Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making, and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2010-05-20T12:36:27","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unemployment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=321","category":"Topic","slug":"unemployment","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unemployment","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/unemployment\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":685,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=321","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/321\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":5,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FL","name":"unemployment","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T16:52:00.588225","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/unemployment\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":7,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

Hong Kong is known for its expansive skyline and deep natural harbour, and with a land mass of 1,104 km<sup>2<\/sup> (426 sq mi) and a population of over seven million people, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Hong Kong's population is 93.6% ethnic Chinese and 6.4% from other groups. Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking majority originate mainly from the neighbouring Canton (now Guangdong) province, from which many of them fled to escape wars and communist rule in China from the 1930s to the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42). Hong Kong Island was first ceded to the UK in perpetuity, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories was put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during the Pacific War (1941–45), after which the British resumed control until 1997. The region espoused minimum government intervention under the ethos of positive non-interventionism during the colonial era. The time period greatly influenced the current culture of Hong Kong, often described as \"East meets West\", and the educational system, which used to loosely follow the system in England until reforms implemented in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" (the other, Macau, attained that status in December 1999). It has a different political system from mainland China. Hong Kong's independent judiciary functions under the common law framework. The Hong Kong Basic Law (its constitutional document) governs its political system, and stipulates that Hong Kong shall have a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and military defence. Although it has a burgeoning multi-party system, a small-circle electorate controls half of its legislature, which led to it being classified a semi-authoritarian regime with highly suppressed political rights. The head of the government, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, is chosen by an Election Committee of 400 to 1,200 members, a situation that will be in effect during the first 20 years of Chinese rule.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a world city and is one of the Al­pha+ cities. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world's most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world but also the highest income inequality among advanced economies. The dense space has also led to a highly developed transportation network with the public transport travelling rate exceeding 90 percent, the highest in the world. Hong Kong has numerous high international rankings in various aspects, such as its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, Human Development Index are all ranked highly. According to estimates from both UN and WHO, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world in 2012. However, air pollution and smog is a serious problem with loose emission standards and high level of carcinogenic PM2.5 compared to other advanced economies.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-04-21T00:23:01","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=952","category":"Country","slug":"hong-kong","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Kong","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/hong-kong\/","woeid":24865698,"placetype":"Country","item_count":665,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=952","longitude":114.154,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/952\/","geohash":"wecpmxu6syrz","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":24,"latitude":22.4112,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PW","name":"Hong Kong","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T19:10:08.268684","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hong-kong\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":307,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e0\/Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg","description":"<p>A <b>protest<\/b> (also called a <b>remonstrance<\/b> or a <b>remonstration<\/b>) is an expression of objection by words or by actions to particular events, policies, or situations.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","category":"Topic","slug":"weather","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":24916,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","name":"weather","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:26:23.330263","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Stampher","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","first_name":"Jillian","id":14,"username":"jillian.stamper"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2KG","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChannelNewsAsia\/status\/517924496334790656","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T06:49:14.867908","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/photo-protesters-stand-in-heavy-rain-in-hong-kong","status":"published"},{"type":"live_video","source":null,"whoas":14,"id":446748,"tweet":null,"slug":"live-video-senior-administration-officials-to-hol","content":"Live video: Senior US officials hold a briefing on the response to the Ebola pandemic - @NBCNews","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/live-video-senior-administration-officials-to-hol","note":null,"media":{"url":null,"provider_url":null,"type":"video","thumbnail_height":null,"original_url":"http:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/msnbc2\/watch\/live-video-white-house-officials-hold-briefing-on-ebola-pandemic-337493571699","width":null,"author_url":null,"resource_uri":"","html":"<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.theplatform.com\/p\/2E2eJC\/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=n_live_ehouse_141003\" width=\"635\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","author_name":null,"id":50706,"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/tve_static-snappytvpoc.nbcuni.com\/snappy\/image\/NBC_News\/323\/975\/ap630394267491.jpg","thumbnail_width":null,"height":null,"title":"","provider_name":""},"pushed":true,"data_type":"nbclivevideo","date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 06:06 PM GMT","shortened_url":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446748\/","push_content":"Live video: Senior US officials hold a briefing on the response to the Ebola pandemic - @NBCNews","updated_date":"2014-10-03T20:39:28.681429","submitter":"feed","topics":[{"id":60148,"image_url":"","description":"Africa’s biggest Ebola outbreak in seven years is impacting people in Guinea and has likely spread to neighboring Liberia and is threatening Sierra Leone. - Bloomberg News","created_on":"2014-03-24T18:26:05.941250","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=60148","category":"HealthEvent","slug":"africa-ebola-outbreak-2014","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_outbreak_2014","recent_count":14,"local_url":"\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":530,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=60148","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/60148\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PoI","name":"Ebola outbreak 2014","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"arc","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":10,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>. Its natural reservoir is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans, through body fluids.<\/p>\n<p>The EBOV genome is approximately 19,000 base pairs long.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Nm","url":"http:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/msnbc2\/watch\/live-video-white-house-officials-hold-briefing-on-ebola-pandemic-337493571699","data":{"resource_uri":"","hds_url":"http:\/\/link.theplatform.com\/s\/2E2eJC\/DkfGm__2fknJ?MBR=TRUE&feed=Live%20Video","ss_url":null,"id":1022,"hls_url":"http:\/\/link.theplatform.com\/s\/2E2eJC\/wOSt_10_NLHJ?MBR=TRUE&feed=Live%20Video","guid":"n_live_ehouse_141003"},"date":"2014-10-03T18:06:41.708183","url_domain":"msnbc.com","importance":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/live-video-senior-administration-officials-to-hol","status":"published"}],"items":[{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":259,"id":446815,"tweet":null,"slug":"internet-video-purports-to-show-execution-of-briti","content":"Internet video purports to show execution of British humanitarian aid worker Alan Henning by Islamic State captors - @AP","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/internet-video-purports-to-show-execution-of-briti","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 08:09 PM GMT","shortened_url":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446815\/","push_content":"Video purports to show execution of British humanitarian aid worker Alan Henning by Islamic State captors - @AP","updated_date":"2014-10-03T20:09:19.396288","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":82188,"image_url":"","description":"<p>Sunni militants led by the Islamic State declared a caliphate that stretches across eastern Syria and much of northern and western Iraq.

The judicial decree that someone be punished in this manner is a <b>death sentence<\/b>, while the actual enforcement is an <b>execution<\/b>. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as <i>capital crimes<\/i> or <i>capital offenses<\/i>. The term <i>capital<\/i> originates from the Latin <i>capitalis<\/i>, literally \"regarding the head\" (referring to execution by beheading).<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment has, in the past, been practiced by most societies, as a punishment for criminals, and political or religious dissidents. Historically, the carrying out of the death sentence was often accompanied by torture, and executions were most often public.<\/p>\n<p>Currently 58 nations actively practice capital punishment, 98 countries have abolished it <i>de jure<\/i> for all crimes, 7 have abolished it for ordinary crimes only (maintain it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 35 have abolished it <i>de facto<\/i> (have not used it for at least ten years and\/or are under moratorium). Amnesty International considers most countries abolitionist; overall, the organisation considers 140 countries to be abolitionist in law or practice. About 90% of all executions in the world take place in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly all countries in the world prohibit the execution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes; since 2009, only Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan have carried out such executions. Executions of this kind are prohibited under international law.<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. In the European Union member states, Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment. The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, also prohibits the use of the death penalty by its members.<\/p>\n<p>The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008 and 2010, non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition. Although many nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in countries where executions take place, such as the People's Republic of China, India, the United States of America and Indonesia, the four most-populous countries in the world, which continue to apply the death penalty (although in India, Indonesia and in many US states it is rarely employed).

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests.

In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","category":"Topic","slug":"war-conflict","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":25716,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","name":"war & conflict","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Or","url":"","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:09:13.677245","url_domain":null,"importance":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/internet-video-purports-to-show-execution-of-briti","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":189,"id":446595,"tweet":null,"slug":"us-employers-added-248000-jobs-in-september-unem","content":"US employers added 248,000 jobs in September; unemployment rate drops to 5.9%, lowest since July 2008 - @BLS_gov, @BloombergTV","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/us-employers-added-248000-jobs-in-september-unem","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 12:33 PM GMT","shortened_url":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446595\/","push_content":"US employers added 248,000 jobs in September; unemployment rate drops to 5.9%, lowest since July 2008 - @BLS_gov, @BloombergTV","updated_date":"2014-10-03T12:33:43.029388","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":10,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":43416,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/59\/World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg","description":"<p>An <b>economic indicator<\/b> is a statistic about an economic activity.

The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate. According to International Labour Organization report, more than 197 million people globally are out of work or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>There remains considerable theoretical debate regarding the causes, consequences and solutions for unemployment. Classical economics, New classical economics, and the Austrian School of economics argue that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment. These theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside, such as unionization, bureaucratic work rules, minimum wage laws, taxes, and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers.<\/p>\n<p>Keynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions. This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers. Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers; these can include financial stimuli, publicly funded job creation, and expansionist monetary policies. Keynes believed that the root cause of unemployment is the desire of investors to receive more money rather than produce more products, which is not possible without public bodies producing new money.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment, there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system. The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization. Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates. Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making, and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2010-05-20T12:36:27","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unemployment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=321","category":"Topic","slug":"unemployment","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unemployment","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/unemployment\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":685,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=321","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/321\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":5,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FL","name":"unemployment","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T16:52:00.588225","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/unemployment\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":43417,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/59\/World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg","description":"<p>An <b>economic indicator<\/b> is a statistic about an economic activity.

Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p>\n<p>The site of many ancient kingdoms and empires, the modern political state of Nigeria has its origins in the British colonization of the region during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries; it emerged from the combination of two neighboring British protectorates: the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate. During the colonial period, the British set up administrative and legal structures whilst retaining traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960, but plunged into civil war several years later. It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships, with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly.<\/p>\n<p>Nigeria is often referred to as the \"Giant of Africa\", due to its large population and economy. With approximately 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. The country is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. Regarding religion, Nigeria is roughly divided in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern and central parts of the country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the northern and southwestern regions. A minority of the population practice religions indigenous to Nigeria, such as those native to Igbo and Yoruba peoples.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Nigeria's economy (GDP) became the largest in Africa, worth more than $500 billion, and overtook South Africa to become the world's 26th largest economy. Furthermore, the debt-to-GDP ratio is only 11 percent (8 percent below the 2012 ratio). By 2050, Nigeria is expected to become one of the world's top 20 economies. The country's oil reserves have played a major role in its growing wealth and influence. Nigeria is considered to be an Emerging market by the World Bank and has been identified as a regional power in Africa. It is also a member of the MINT group of countries, which are widely seen as the globe's next \"BRIC-like\" economies.

The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state.<\/p>\n<p>The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the preexisting settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. Named in honor of George Washington, the City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia and created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District in 1871.<\/p>\n<p>Washington, D.C., had an estimated population of 646,449 in 2013, the 23rd most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's population to more than one million during the workweek. The Washington metropolitan area, of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.8 million, the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The centers of all three branches of the federal government of the United States are in the District, including the Congress, president, and Supreme Court. Washington is home to many national monuments and museums, which are primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations.<\/p>\n<p>A locally elected mayor and a 13‑member council have governed the District since 1973.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

It covers an area of 111,369 square kilometres (43,000 sq mi) and is home to about 4 million people. English is the official language and over thirty indigenous languages are also spoken within the country. Its coastline is composed mostly of mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest.<\/p>\n<p>Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin.<\/p>\n<p>In 1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political, social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.<\/p>\n<p>The country began to modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman. Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the country's economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the population continue to live below the international poverty line.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-11T01:02:22","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1569","category":"Country","slug":"liberia","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/liberia\/","woeid":23424876,"placetype":"Country","item_count":150,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1569","longitude":-9.42859,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1569\/","geohash":"ec1k9qwk1fmb","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":6,"latitude":6.45242,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZT","name":"Liberia","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:14:32.043753","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/liberia\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":10,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85182,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T09:21:27.277422","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85182","category":"Person","slug":"ashoka-mukpo","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":7,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85182","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85182\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":7,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WJ4","name":"Ashoka Mukpo","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T17:51:39.200576","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":84637,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-09-30T01:38:37.071016","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=84637","category":"POI","slug":"presbyterian-hospital-dallas-dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Presbyterian_Hospital_of_Dallas","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/presbyterian-hospital-dallas-dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":56377662,"placetype":"POI","item_count":12,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=84637","longitude":-96.7628,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/84637\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":2,"latitude":32.882,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WBH","name":"Presbyterian Hospital-Dallas, Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T19:36:04.091055","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/presbyterian-hospital-dallas-dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5","category":"Person","slug":"barack-obama","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/barack-obama\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":8216,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5","primary":true,"longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":2,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F","name":"Barack Obama","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T12:08:56.762278","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/barack-obama\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1050,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0e\/DCmontage4.jpg","description":"<p><b>Washington, D.C.<\/b>, formally the <b>District of Columbia<\/b> and commonly referred to as <b>Washington<\/b>, \"<b>the District<\/b>\", or simply <b>D.C.<\/b>, is the capital of the United States. The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state.<\/p>\n<p>The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the preexisting settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. Named in honor of George Washington, the City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia and created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District in 1871.<\/p>\n<p>Washington, D.C., had an estimated population of 646,449 in 2013, the 23rd most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's population to more than one million during the workweek. The Washington metropolitan area, of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.8 million, the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The centers of all three branches of the federal government of the United States are in the District, including the Congress, president, and Supreme Court. Washington is home to many national monuments and museums, which are primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations.<\/p>\n<p>A locally elected mayor and a 13‑member council have governed the District since 1973.

It covers an area of 111,369 square kilometres (43,000 sq mi) and is home to about 4 million people. English is the official language and over thirty indigenous languages are also spoken within the country. Its coastline is composed mostly of mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest.<\/p>\n<p>Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin.<\/p>\n<p>In 1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political, social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.<\/p>\n<p>The country began to modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman. Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the country's economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the population continue to live below the international poverty line.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-11T01:02:22","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1569","category":"Country","slug":"liberia","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/liberia\/","woeid":23424876,"placetype":"Country","item_count":150,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1569","longitude":-9.42859,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1569\/","geohash":"ec1k9qwk1fmb","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":6,"latitude":6.45242,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZT","name":"Liberia","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:14:32.043753","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/liberia\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":10,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85182,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T09:21:27.277422","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85182","category":"Person","slug":"ashoka-mukpo","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":7,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85182","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85182\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":7,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WJ4","name":"Ashoka Mukpo","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T17:51:39.200576","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

In 1986, control of NBC passed to General Electric (GE), with GE's $6.4 billion purchase of RCA.

He was succeeded by Jeff Zucker. The network is currently part of the media company NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast, which formerly operated NBCUniversal in a joint venture with General Electric from 2011 to 2013 (and before that, jointly owned by GE and Vivendi). As a result of the merger, Zucker left NBC and was replaced by Comcast executive Steve Burke.<\/p>\n<p>NBC has eleven owned-and-operated stations and nearly 200 affiliates in the United States, some of which are also seen in Canada, along with NBC-branded international channels in South Korea and Germany.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2010-07-20T19:37:09","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NBC\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1319","category":"TVChannel","slug":"nbc","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NBC","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/nbc\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":163,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1319","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1319\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":7,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/VR","name":"NBC","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T17:51:39.200576","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/nbc\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":67,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/86\/Smallpox_eradication_team.jpg","description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

Sweden borders Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the Øresund. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of about 9.6 million. Sweden has a low population density of 21 inhabitants per square kilometre (54 \/sq mi) with the population mostly concentrated to the southern half of the country. About 85% of the population live in urban areas. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested.<\/p>\n<p>Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Gotar and Svear tribes and contributing to the sea peoples known as Vikings. Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century, the country expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire. The empire grew to be one of the great powers of Europe in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, remaining a largely neutral nation. The country played a role in humanitarian efforts during World Wars I and II, taking in refugees from German-occupied Europe. With the ending of the Cold War, Sweden joined the European Union, although declined NATO membership.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, with Carl XVI Gustaf as king, organised as a parliamentary democracy. The seat of government is the capital Stockholm, which is also the most populous city. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, and the cabinet. Sweden is a unitary state, currently divided into twenty-one counties.<\/p>\n<p>Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. It has the world's eighth-highest per capita income and ranks highly in numerous comparisons of national performance, including quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, equality, prosperity and human development. Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995, although remains outside the Eurozone.

The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes also loosely applied to the whole state), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","category":"Country","slug":"united-kingdom","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","recent_count":2,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","woeid":23424975,"placetype":"Country","item_count":6815,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","longitude":-2.23001,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":9,"latitude":54.3141,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","name":"United Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":82666,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-09-14T14:16:45.437491","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=82666","category":"Person","slug":"alan-henning","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/alan-henning\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":8,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=82666","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/82666\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":4,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/VfU","name":"Alan Henning","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:15:43.642118","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/alan-henning\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":72940,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4a\/Auguste_Vaillant_execution.jpg","description":"<p><b>Capital punishment<\/b> or the <b>death penalty<\/b> is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The judicial decree that someone be punished in this manner is a <b>death sentence<\/b>, while the actual enforcement is an <b>execution<\/b>. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as <i>capital crimes<\/i> or <i>capital offenses<\/i>. The term <i>capital<\/i> originates from the Latin <i>capitalis<\/i>, literally \"regarding the head\" (referring to execution by beheading).<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment has, in the past, been practiced by most societies, as a punishment for criminals, and political or religious dissidents. Historically, the carrying out of the death sentence was often accompanied by torture, and executions were most often public.<\/p>\n<p>Currently 58 nations actively practice capital punishment, 98 countries have abolished it <i>de jure<\/i> for all crimes, 7 have abolished it for ordinary crimes only (maintain it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 35 have abolished it <i>de facto<\/i> (have not used it for at least ten years and\/or are under moratorium). Amnesty International considers most countries abolitionist; overall, the organisation considers 140 countries to be abolitionist in law or practice. About 90% of all executions in the world take place in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly all countries in the world prohibit the execution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes; since 2009, only Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan have carried out such executions. Executions of this kind are prohibited under international law.<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. In the European Union member states, Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment. The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, also prohibits the use of the death penalty by its members.<\/p>\n<p>The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008 and 2010, non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition. Although many nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in countries where executions take place, such as the People's Republic of China, India, the United States of America and Indonesia, the four most-populous countries in the world, which continue to apply the death penalty (although in India, Indonesia and in many US states it is rarely employed).

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","category":"Topic","slug":"war-conflict","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":25716,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","name":"war & conflict","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Oz","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mradamtaylor\/status\/518130362749558785","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:17:29.639765","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/voice-of-executioner-in-video-showing-execution-of","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":53,"id":446791,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Telegraph\/status\/518120869533462528","name":"The Telegraph","id":249058,"date":"2014-10-03T19:30:16","location":"London, UK","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518120869533462528","screen_name":"Telegraph","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507136992077832192\/BBMrT1P7_normal.png","user_id":"16343974","content":"World's first womb transplant baby born in Sweden http:\/\/t.co\/yxXYEulaas"},"slug":"the-worlds-1st-womb-transplant-baby-has-been-born","content":"The world's 1st womb-transplant baby has been born in Sweden - @Telegraph","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/the-worlds-1st-womb-transplant-baby-has-been-born","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 07:40 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1BDNBBW","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446791\/","push_content":"The world's 1st womb-transplant baby has been born in Sweden - @Telegraph","updated_date":"2014-10-03T19:40:27.346103","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":2575,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4c\/Flag_of_Sweden.svg","description":"<p><b>Sweden<\/b> (\/ˈswiːdən\/ <i><b>SWEE<\/b>-dən<\/i>; Swedish: <i>Sverige<\/i> [ˈsværjɛ]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially the <b>Kingdom of Sweden<\/b> (Swedish:  <i>Konungariket Sverige<\/i> ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. Sweden borders Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the Øresund. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of about 9.6 million. Sweden has a low population density of 21 inhabitants per square kilometre (54 \/sq mi) with the population mostly concentrated to the southern half of the country. About 85% of the population live in urban areas. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested.<\/p>\n<p>Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Gotar and Svear tribes and contributing to the sea peoples known as Vikings. Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century, the country expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire. The empire grew to be one of the great powers of Europe in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, remaining a largely neutral nation. The country played a role in humanitarian efforts during World Wars I and II, taking in refugees from German-occupied Europe. With the ending of the Cold War, Sweden joined the European Union, although declined NATO membership.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, with Carl XVI Gustaf as king, organised as a parliamentary democracy. The seat of government is the capital Stockholm, which is also the most populous city. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, and the cabinet. Sweden is a unitary state, currently divided into twenty-one counties.<\/p>\n<p>Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. It has the world's eighth-highest per capita income and ranks highly in numerous comparisons of national performance, including quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, equality, prosperity and human development. Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995, although remains outside the Eurozone.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring.

Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2OT","url":"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/health\/healthnews\/11139991\/The-first-baby-has-been-born-following-a-womb-transplant.html","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T19:40:24.233836","url_domain":"telegraph.co.uk","importance":4,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/the-worlds-1st-womb-transplant-baby-has-been-born","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":53,"id":446774,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MacFarlaneNews\/status\/518109974539804672","name":"Scott MacFarlane","id":249043,"date":"2014-10-03T18:46:58","location":"Washington, D.C.","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518109974539804672","screen_name":"MacFarlaneNews","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444231853403541505\/KUUgQ5va_normal.jpeg","user_id":"20280088","content":"Rockville, Maryland hospital: Treating patient w\/ \"Flu-like symptoms &amp; a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola\""},"slug":"rockville-md-hospital-treating-patient-with-f","content":"Rockville, Md., hospital: Treating patient with 'flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola' - @MacFarlaneNews","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/rockville-md-hospital-treating-patient-with-f","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 06:57 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1BDKAl9","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446774\/","push_content":"Rockville, Md., hospital: Treating patient with 'flu-like symptoms and a travel history that matches criteria for possible Ebola' - @MacFarlaneNews","updated_date":"2014-10-03T18:57:37.088317","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":60148,"image_url":"","description":"Africa’s biggest Ebola outbreak in seven years is impacting people in Guinea and has likely spread to neighboring Liberia and is threatening Sierra Leone. - Bloomberg News","created_on":"2014-03-24T18:26:05.941250","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=60148","category":"HealthEvent","slug":"africa-ebola-outbreak-2014","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_outbreak_2014","recent_count":14,"local_url":"\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":530,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=60148","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/60148\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PoI","name":"Ebola outbreak 2014","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"arc","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15013,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1d\/Rockville%2C_Maryland_Infobox_Montage_1.png","description":"<p><b>Rockville<\/b> is a city located in the central region of Montgomery County, Maryland.

The judicial decree that someone be punished in this manner is a <b>death sentence<\/b>, while the actual enforcement is an <b>execution<\/b>. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as <i>capital crimes<\/i> or <i>capital offenses<\/i>. The term <i>capital<\/i> originates from the Latin <i>capitalis<\/i>, literally \"regarding the head\" (referring to execution by beheading).<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment has, in the past, been practiced by most societies, as a punishment for criminals, and political or religious dissidents. Historically, the carrying out of the death sentence was often accompanied by torture, and executions were most often public.<\/p>\n<p>Currently 58 nations actively practice capital punishment, 98 countries have abolished it <i>de jure<\/i> for all crimes, 7 have abolished it for ordinary crimes only (maintain it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 35 have abolished it <i>de facto<\/i> (have not used it for at least ten years and\/or are under moratorium). Amnesty International considers most countries abolitionist; overall, the organisation considers 140 countries to be abolitionist in law or practice. About 90% of all executions in the world take place in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly all countries in the world prohibit the execution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes; since 2009, only Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan have carried out such executions. Executions of this kind are prohibited under international law.<\/p>\n<p>Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. In the European Union member states, Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment. The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, also prohibits the use of the death penalty by its members.<\/p>\n<p>The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008 and 2010, non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition. Although many nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in countries where executions take place, such as the People's Republic of China, India, the United States of America and Indonesia, the four most-populous countries in the world, which continue to apply the death penalty (although in India, Indonesia and in many US states it is rarely employed).

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","category":"Organization","slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":985,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":17,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85267,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T20:13:40.040658","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85267","category":"Person","slug":"peter-kassig","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/peter-kassig\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":1,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85267","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85267\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WLR","name":"Peter Kassig","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:15:15.664732","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/peter-kassig\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","slug":"crime-courts","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","recent_count":11,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":43905,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":31,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:51:12.884461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":15,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","category":"Topic","slug":"war-conflict","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","recent_count":6,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":25716,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","name":"war & conflict","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:39:42.398461","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","first_name":"Tom","id":7,"username":"tom.brew"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2Oy","url":"","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T20:15:15.664732","url_domain":null,"importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/a-video-released-by-the-islamic-state-purporting-t","status":"published"},{"type":"text","source":null,"whoas":49,"id":446738,"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/USATODAY\/status\/518092538348331008","name":"USA TODAY","id":249002,"date":"2014-10-03T17:37:41","location":"USA TODAY HQ, McLean, Va.","resource_uri":"","tweet_id":"518092538348331008","screen_name":"USATODAY","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461560356314165249\/Ik1AqEj4_normal.png","user_id":"15754281","content":"#BREAKING Pentagon: Ebola troop levels could hit 4,000 http:\/\/t.co\/P8IWQZbwM5"},"slug":"pentagon-as-many-as-4000-troops-may-be-deployed","content":"Pentagon: As many as 4,000 troops may be deployed to West Africa to help combat Ebola - @USATODAY","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/pentagon-as-many-as-4000-troops-may-be-deployed","note":null,"media":null,"pushed":true,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Oct 03, 2014, 05:42 PM GMT","shortened_url":"http:\/\/usat.ly\/ZBBXff","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/446738\/","push_content":"Pentagon: As many as 4,000 troops may be deployed to West Africa to help combat Ebola - @USATODAY","updated_date":"2014-10-03T17:42:31.376590","submitter":"editor","topics":[{"id":60148,"image_url":"","description":"Africa’s biggest Ebola outbreak in seven years is impacting people in Guinea and has likely spread to neighboring Liberia and is threatening Sierra Leone. - Bloomberg News","created_on":"2014-03-24T18:26:05.941250","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=60148","category":"HealthEvent","slug":"africa-ebola-outbreak-2014","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ebola_outbreak_2014","recent_count":14,"local_url":"\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":530,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=60148","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/60148\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":37,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PoI","name":"Ebola outbreak 2014","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"arc","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/africa-ebola-outbreak-2014\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":12096,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d0\/Flag_of_West_Africa_%E2%80%95_Economic_Community_of_West_African_States_%28ECOWAS%29.jpg","description":"<p><b>West Africa<\/b>, also called <b>Western Africa<\/b> and the <b>West of Africa<\/b>, is the westernmost subregion of the African continent.

Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion.

Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

The name is a trademark name, and is a play on the audiophile term Hi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any \"wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards\". However, since most modern WLANs are based on these standards, the term \"Wi-Fi\" is used in general English as a synonym for \"WLAN\". Only Wi-Fi products that complete Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification testing successfully may use the \"Wi-Fi CERTIFIED\" trademark.<\/p>\n<p>Many devices can use Wi-Fi, e.g., personal computers, video-game consoles, smartphones, some digital cameras, tablet computers and digital audio players. These can connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can comprise an area as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wi-Fi can be less secure than wired connections (such as Ethernet) because an intruder does not need a physical connection. Web pages that use SSL are secure but unencrypted internet access can easily be detected by intruders. Because of this, Wi-Fi has adopted various encryption technologies. The early encryption WEP, proved easy to break. Higher quality protocols (WPA, WPA2) were added later. An optional feature added in 2007, called Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password. The Wi-Fi Alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-04-29T06:49:19.192759","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wi-Fi\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=64365","category":"Technology","slug":"wi-fi","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wi-Fi","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/wi-fi\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":21,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=64365","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/64365\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/QuJ","name":"Wi-Fi","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T18:19:43.255480","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/wi-fi\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":25,"image_url":"","description":"<p><b>Tech<\/b> may refer to:<\/p>\n<ul><li>an abbreviation for technology, and terms that are derived from it\n<ul><li>technical support, services providing assistance with technology products<\/li>\n<li>techno, a form of electronic dance music<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>a technical problem, in airline jargon e.g. \"the plane's gone tech\"<\/li>\n<li>a technician, a worker in a field of technology e.g. \"We may need to call in a tech\"<\/li>\n<li>Tech 2 (or Tech II), an electronic On-board diagnostics tool for General Motors cars<\/li>\n<li>Tech N9ne (born 1971), rapper from Kansas City, Missouri<\/li>\n<li>Tech metal a subgenre of Heavy Metal<\/li>\n<li>The Tech River in France<\/li>\n<li>Ghettotech, the genre of Miami bass-techno fusion<\/li>\n<li>Tech Mo'r, a member of <i>Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes<\/i><\/li>\n<li>A nickname for the Church of Scientology's teachings, dubbed <i>Scientology Technology<\/i>; also referred to as <i>LRH (L.

It covers an area of 111,369 square kilometres (43,000 sq mi) and is home to about 4 million people. English is the official language and over thirty indigenous languages are also spoken within the country. Its coastline is composed mostly of mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest.<\/p>\n<p>Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin.<\/p>\n<p>In 1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political, social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.<\/p>\n<p>The country began to modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman. Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the country's economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the population continue to live below the international poverty line.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-11T01:02:22","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1569","category":"Country","slug":"liberia","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberia","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/liberia\/","woeid":23424876,"placetype":"Country","item_count":150,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1569","longitude":-9.42859,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1569\/","geohash":"ec1k9qwk1fmb","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":6,"latitude":6.45242,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZT","name":"Liberia","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:14:32.043753","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/liberia\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":1232,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/6\/69\/New_Haven_montage_2.jpg","description":"<p><b>New Haven<\/b> is the second-largest city in Connecticut after Bridgeport with a population at the 2010 United States Census of 129,779 people.

In 1718, the school was renamed \"Yale College\" in recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale, a governor of the British East India Company. Established to train Connecticut ministers in theology and sacred languages, by 1777 the school's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences. During the 19th century Yale gradually incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.<\/p>\n<p>Yale is organized into twelve constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences, and ten professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in Western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The University's assets include an endowment valued at $20.8 billion as of 2013, the second-largest of any academic institution in the world. The Yale University Library, serving all twelve schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and are organized into a system of residential colleges. Almost all faculty teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. Students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League.<\/p>\n<p>Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 13 living billionaires, and many foreign heads of state. 52 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University as students, faculty, or staff, and 230 Rhodes Scholars (the second most in the world) graduated from the University.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2014-03-11T14:44:37.062049","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yale_University\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=58659","category":"University","slug":"yale-university","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yale_University","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/yale-university\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=58659","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/58659\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":1,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PQH","name":"Yale University","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T15:14:32.043753","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/yale-university\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":67,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/86\/Smallpox_eradication_team.jpg","description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat. However, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,241,162 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,810,913 as of July 1, 2013. The metropolitan economy is the sixth largest in the United States, with a 2012 real GDP of $420.34 billion. In 2013 the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment, and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) with more than three million non-farm jobs. In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a \"beta plus\" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. Dallas is also ranked 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas was founded in 1841 and formally incorporated as a city in February 1856. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, computer technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation. Located in North Texas, Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea.<\/p>\n<p>It was developed because of construction of major railroad lines here; it became a hub in 1873. It was connected to Houston and other major cities that were railroad cities. It was booming by the late 19th and early 20th century, and was the world center of leather manufacture and harnessmaking. The interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced and consolidated Dallas' prominence. As with the railroads, east\/west and north\/south highways converged here. Four major interstate highways converge in the city, and a fifth interstate loops around it. Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector, and a major inland port, due largely to the presence of Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:10","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1421","category":"Town","slug":"dallas-tx-us","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas","recent_count":5,"local_url":"\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","woeid":2388929,"placetype":"Town","item_count":759,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1421","longitude":-96.7959,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1421\/","geohash":"9vg4mr5dr8ww","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":15,"latitude":32.7818,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/W5","name":"Dallas, TX, US","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T20:54:48.506015","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/accounts\/6395980\/events\/2598380\/player?width=480&height=270&autoPlay=false&mute=false\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> <\/iframe>","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dallas-tx-us\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":10,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":14434,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3f\/Ebola_virus_em.png","description":"<p><i><b>Ebola virus<\/b><\/i> (<b>EBOV<\/b>, formerly designated <i><b>Zaire ebolavirus<\/b><\/i>) is the sole member of the <i>Zaire ebolavirus<\/i> species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>.

After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia.

The capital, Baghdad, is in the center of the country. Around 97% of the country's 36,000,000 people are Muslims, mainly Shias, Sunnis, and ethnic Kurds.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf and its territory encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through the center of Iraq and flow into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. Theses rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.<\/p>\n<p>The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as Mesopotamia and thought to be the birthplace of writing and the world's oldest civilizations. The area has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC.

Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States of America and its allies, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria.

Abbott is the Member of Parliament representing the Sydney-based Division of Warringah, having first been elected at a 1994 by-election.<\/p>\n<p>Abbott was born in London, England, to an Australian mother and English father, and emigrated to Sydney with his parents in 1960. Prior to entering Parliament, he studied for a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Sydney, and later for a Master of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics as a Rhodes Scholar at The Queen's College, Oxford.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating, Abbott trained as a Roman Catholic seminarian, later working as a journalist, manager and political advisor. In 1992, he was appointed director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, a position he held until 1994, when he was successfully elected to parliament at the Warringah by-election. Abbott was first appointed to Cabinet following the 1998 election, as part of the Second Howard Ministry, becoming Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. In 2003, he became Minister for Health and Ageing, retaining this position until the defeat of the Howard Government at the 2007 election. Initially serving in the Shadow Cabinets of Brendan Nelson and then Malcolm Turnbull, he resigned from the frontbench in November 2009 in protest against Turnbull's support for the Rudd Government's proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Forcing a leadership ballot on the subject, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41 to become the party's leader and Leader of the Opposition.<\/p>\n<p>Abbott led the Coalition at the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. Following negotiations, Labor formed a Government with the support of one Green MP and three independent MPs, and Abbott was re-elected as Liberal Leader unopposed.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","slug":"united-states","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","recent_count":4,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","woeid":23424977,"placetype":"Country","item_count":14170,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":21,"latitude":37.1679,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"location","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","moderation_status":"approved"},{"id":85182,"image_url":"","description":"","created_on":"2014-10-03T09:21:27.277422","image_credit":"","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85182","category":"Person","slug":"ashoka-mukpo","wikipedia_url":"","recent_count":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":7,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85182","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85182\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":7,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WJ4","name":"Ashoka Mukpo","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T17:51:39.200576","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"tag","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ashoka-mukpo\/","moderation_status":"needs_review"},{"id":742,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/71\/US_CDC_logo.svg","description":"<p>The <b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<\/b> (<b>CDC<\/b>) is the national public health institute of the United States.

Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus and its species were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus; the virus (but not its species) was renamed to \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. The species is a virological taxon species included in the genus <i>Ebolavirus<\/i>, family <i>Filoviridae<\/i> (whose members are called Filovirus), order <i>Mononegavirales<\/i>. The Zaire ebolavirus species is also the type species (reference or example species) for <i>ebolavirus<\/i>. Its natural reservoir is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans, through body fluids.<\/p>\n<p>The EBOV genome is approximately 19,000 base pairs long.

In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in \"<i>good health<\/i>\" or \"<i>healthy<\/i>\"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.<\/p>\n<p>Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences. The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments. In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions, and spirituality; these are referred to as \"determinants of health.\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect your health.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health\">Wikipedia<\/a>","muted_by_default":false,"active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=67","category":"Topic","slug":"health","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","recent_count":16,"local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","woeid":null,"placetype":"","item_count":4610,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","longitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/67\/","geohash":"","twitter_username":null,"daily_count":42,"latitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BF","name":"health","latest_item_date":"2014-10-03T21:36:49.543564","facebookchat":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health\/","moderation_status":"approved"}],"author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Stampher","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","first_name":"Jillian","id":14,"username":"jillian.stamper"},"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B2IK","url":"","data":null,"date":"2014-10-03T00:31:36.756796","url_domain":null,"importance":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/10\/03\/nbc-news-president-deborah-turness-on-freelancer-w","status":"published"}]}

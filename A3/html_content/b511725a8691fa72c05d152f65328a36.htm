		<p>&#8220;The naming of cats is a difficult matter<br />
It&#8217;s isn&#8217;t just one of your holiday games&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>So said T.S Eliot, and I&#8217;m inclined to agree with him. Three names apiece, one of which &#8220;THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess&#8221; &#8211; I have enough trouble remembering my own, what with all of these trailing diminutives; feathery scraps of childhood.</p>
<p>There are many things to love about the <em>felidae</em>. The light behind their eyes, that <em>tapetum lucidum</em>, so as to to see between worlds. The way they will greet, not with the wet manners of a dog, but with a dry nose and tall tail-tip. There is a certain pleasure to be had in noting the pause, the wavering head, as they watch for your approach with open hands and blue-black tone. Even the most docile feline carries the glint of a smile.</p>
<p>Creatures like the crocodile and the hawk were worked into the pyramid walls of ancient Egypt, were known as gods and goddesses under the papyrus light; surrounded by hieroglyphics simple in their elegance and, at times, complex as data encryption.</p>

<p>A cat who would speak with you at length, speaks through the riddle-dance that is appealing in its vagueness. Easy to lose yourself between the muted lines, to forget what it was you were meaning to ask. This is a preferable state when running from details, responsibilities, predictabilities, but the adult world is seemingly governed by such tedious moments, when only the finest-nib clarity will do. I&#8217;ve caught myself laughing (rueful rub of the cheek) at my own frustration with an Access Denied. Encouragement reaps its own rewards. </p>
<p>Who would go so far as to break his own limbs to walk as a cat, when no cat would wish to walk as a man?</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the Alchemist had turned itself into wasn&#8217;t a cat.<br />
Half clothed in mist, it trudged painfully towards them from some lunar distance, supporting itself on a staff made from the leg of a panther&#8230; Lost in a maze of ruptured highways &#8211; burning with rage and desire down every wrenched, coppery perspective, tottering through constant darkness towards every gleam of daylight, deluded by mirror-images, led astray by the very mathematics that had allowed it to penetrate the Old Changing Way: deceived, dazed and disorientated &#8211; it had begun to disintegrate. Where cat and catskin had once run seamlessly together, all was in rags.&#8221; &#8211; Gabriel King, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wildroad/index.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Wild Road.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Crippled by his own hand, each limb contorted and tortured into the supple lines of the feral way, the Alchemist is infused with the energy of sacrificial victims. To control the Golden Cat &#8211; that symbolic focus of all natural life &#8211; he would walk the wild roads, tying them up in agonized knots, to gain power over this world and the next. We know the highways as &#8220;leylines&#8221;, in folk lore; but King &#8211; the pseudonym of writing pair Jane Johnson and M. John Harrison &#8211; employs a lexicon and syntax reminiscent of the free will carried in all wild things, taking the audience between transitions of wary poise, spitfire instinct and playfulness. On the ghost-roads, the smallest feline casts a long and sabre-toothed shadow.</p>
<p>It was through <em>The Wild Road</em> that I became aware of &#8220;narrative voice&#8221; as something distinct from my own, or that of authors I admired. The protagonist, Tag, is a Burmilla kitten whose movements leap out from the page in keeping with his thoughts:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Alone&#8221;, thought Tag.<br />
He tested this idea until sudden panic swept through him. He ran round and round the lawn until he was tired again. He licked his fur in the sunshine for ten minutes. He couldn&#8217;t think what to do. He jumped up onto a windowsill and rubbed both sides of his face on the window pane. &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; he demanded. But clearly it would not be feeding him today&#8230;<br />
He had a new idea. He would feed himself.<br />
&#8220;Eat a bee,&#8221; he thought.<br />
He thought: &#8220;Eat more than one.&#8221;<br />
And he tore off excitedly across the lawn.&#8217; &#8211; pg 20</p>
<p>This staccato style would quickly become tiresome in another context. This is a life lived close to the ground, defined by the smallest details: that which only a cat would notice and remark upon. Dappled with feline lore and mythology, the novel is narrated in the singular (Tag) and the plural &#8211; the nine lives of the cat &#8211; infused with the innocent-arrogance of the species.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those families bade us welcome and we went into their homes of our own free will, and stayed on our own terms. They treated us like deities, each cat a god in its own house &#8211; gifts and offerings, and prayers for a share in our fertilitiltiy and health, for they were a sickly and superstitious lot.<br />
Before long, they were raising temples, drawing our image on the walls like their ancestors before them. In the new drawings we were guardians of the doors of night, guardians of the realms of the dead. We sat at the frontiers of the shadow kingdom; we watched over the spirits of the dead, to guard them in their long sleep.<br />
The same old fears, the same old hopes.&#8221; &#8211; pg 172.</p>
<p>Each twisting strand weaves the historical with the modern, passing from Bubastis through London to Tintagel head, along the ghost-roads where nothing is quite what it seems. It hit me between the eyes. Aged eleven, seeking something more than the well-shaped but quaint books that had papered my childhood thus far. They were too obviously human. When Tag chases bubbles around his home, he is &#8220;as leggy and unsteady, as easily surprised, as easy to tease, as full of daft energy as every kitten&#8221;, progressing from this haven of soft humans and pale light into the wider world; drawn on his quest by a mischievous magpie with an agenda, and a one-eyed black cat with a life layered by papyrus, frost and fire. As even the Majicou knew, through his collective lives as keeper of the roads, the power to move between the primal state and the domestic one comes with a price:</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8221;So&#8221;, he said, &#8220;what am I to tell you, Tag?<br />
That if, as the pretty myth has it, cats are allotted nine lives, I have lived out eight of mine? It would be true to say that. That I am as old as the highways I care for, and which sustain me in return? That cats once got up on their hind legs at night and held not just a parliament but a just parliament with human beings? Ridiculous. No cat has ever wanted to walk like a man. Yet it&#8217;s a pity we can&#8217;t talk to them, Tag.&#8221;&#8216; &#8211; pgs 135-6.</p>
<p>Such a care, to know what you cannot speak of.</p>
<p>Peter .S. Beagle&#8217;s story, <em>The Last Unicorn</em>, is a work of art coloured bittersweet with a love transcending shape and time. The scars on the face of a warrior, the marks on a wizard&#8217;s hands, map their own stories. Even as the unicorn leaves an inevitable trail along the roads of mankind, so the world of mortality marks her in turn with the necessary lessons of care and regret; a heavier burden for one who had lived pale and distant as the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sky spins and drags everything along with it &#8230; but you stand still. You never see anything just once. I wish you could be a princess for a little while, or a flower, or a duck. Something that can&#8217;t wait.&#8221; &#8211; Molly Grue.</p>
<p>When changed into a woman by the well-meaning (somewhat undisciplined) magician Schmendrick, to save her from the Red Bull, the wilderness lives on in her eyes, for a time at least; but the  grey world heaps dust on the memories of wild beasts and woodlands, and that aching fear for her people which began the quest, begins to fade:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am two &#8211; myself, and this other that you call &#8216;my lady&#8217;. For she is here as truly as I am now, though once she was only a veil over me. She walks in the castle, she sleeps, she dresses herself, she takes her meals, and she thinks her own thoughts. If she has no power to heal, or to quiet, still she has another magic. Men speak to her, saying &#8216;Lady Amalthea&#8217;, and she answers them, or she does not answer. The king is always watching her out of his pale eyes, wondering what she is, and the king&#8217;s son wounds himself with loving her and wonders who she is. And every day she searches the sea and the sky, the castle and the courtyard, the keep and the king&#8217;s face, for something she cannot always remember. What is it, what is it that she is seeking in this strange place? She knew a moment ago, but she has forgotten.&#8221; </p>
<p>She turned her face to Molly Grue, and her eyes were not the unicorn&#8217;s eyes. They were lovely still, but in a way that had a name, as a human woman is beautiful. Their depth could be sounded and learned, and their degree of darkness was quite describable. Molly saw fear and loss and bewilderment when she looked into them, and herself; and nothing more.&#8217; &#8211; Ch 10.</p>
<p>Yet it is the cat of King Haggard&#8217;s castle who knows her for what she is. Bound by his own language to speak through the twisting riddles, of what is and what might be, his truth is never more than an eye-glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she is a unicorn?&#8221; Molly demanded. &#8220;And why were you afraid to let her touch you? I saw you. You were afraid of her.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,&#8221; the cat replied without rancor. &#8220;I would not waste time in foolishness if I were you. As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be deceived by appearances. Unlike human beings, who enjoy them&#8230;. You have very little time. Soon she will no longer remember who she is, or why she came to this place, and the Red Bull will no longer roar in the night for her. It may be that she will marry the good prince, who loves her&#8230;&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the wine drinks itself,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when the skull speaks, when the clock strikes the right time &#8211; only then will you find the tunnel that leads to the Red Bull&#8217;s lair.&#8221; He tucked his paws under his chest and added, &#8220;There&#8217;s a trick to it, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; Molly said grimly&#8230; &#8220;oh, cat, wouldn&#8217;t it be simpler just to show me the tunnel? You know where it is, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of course I know,&#8221; answered the cat, with a glinting, curling yawn. &#8220;Of course it would be simpler for me to show you. Save a lot of time and trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was becoming a sleepy drawl, and Molly realized that, like King Haggard himself, he was losing interest. Quickly she asked him, &#8220;Tell me one thing, then. What became of the unicorns? Where are they?&#8221;<br />
The cat yawned again. &#8220;Near and far, far and near,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;They are within sight of your lady&#8217;s eyes, but almost out of reach of her memory. They are coming closer, and they are going away.&#8221; He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Molly&#8217;s breath came like rope, fretting against her harsh throat. &#8220;Damn you, why won&#8217;t you help me?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why must you always speak in riddles?&#8221;<br />
One eye opened slowly, green and gold as sunlight in the woods. The cat said, &#8220;I am what I am. I would tell you what you want to know if I could, for you have been kind to me. But I am a cat, and no cat anywhere ever gave anyone a straight answer.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>The cat knows what it knows, and will continue to look on our world with a crooked head and a mutable smile. We&#8217;re still new to the game, after all.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Who am I, as a writer?<br />
Well, I couldn&#8217;t tell you that. I have no deep insight into anything beyond immediate experience &#8211; which I suppose you could say is true of many of us, I don&#8217;t know, I didn&#8217;t research it. I read enough to keep my brain fired and fried by turns, but it&#8217;s a constant process of catch-up, after over a decade of mental stagnation. Oh ja, I could tell you about the interior of various mental health institutions, and how it feels to see the lights of an ambulance bracket the walls, and the dialling-down spiral of knowing you have disappointed so many people who care about you, who you care for &#8211; </p>
<p>But who wants to read that sort of noir life, back and forth, time and again?</p>
<p>I could tell you about counting calories like grains of sand through the hourglass, and how it feels when your heels crack for pacing; what it means to know your grades are failing because you can&#8217;t keep up, juggling mental and physical duress -<br />
That conflict doesn&#8217;t leave in a hurry, it&#8217;s why I have trouble with employment -</p>
<p>But again, how to spin that line to a sustainable cobweb?</p>
<p>I could tell you about the different types of cat coat, the ticked and the spotted, the swimming breeds, the docile v.s. the gregarious. I could go off on one about the many cat shows attended, with the surprising variety of stalls showcasing craft innovation (kitty alarm clock, anyone?) and the cages filled with pacing, bawling, squeaking, hiding, wide-eye denizens of another world that we&#8217;ll never know, because you cannot bottle smoke. Even caught behind the bars, those jungle eyes found me, and I wondered who was the real prisoner.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll tell you what colour your name is, and how to find it in a song; where to weave it into words that might spill over to poetic enjambment, a river-run of themes, time, love, relief, abandonment, chaotic self-delusion. <em>Write what you know.<br />
Know what you write?</em></p>
<p>So many little things, spun away into an endless world of tomorrows. So many signals replayed. Refrains. I often watch myself in writing and find a wire-grin: &#8220;She&#8217;s at it again, look &#8211; haven&#8217;t we seen that before?&#8221;</p>
<p>My short-term memory is shot to shit. Prolonged malnutrition tends to inhibit cognition, even years after some semblance of mental and physical health have been restored. I must read and reread what I know, what I thought I knew, until getting into debates and conversations and finding myself tits-up for details &#8230; And trying to write essays and articles, when the facts and the words were tucked safely behind my ears, a<em> tapetum lucidum</em> for the eye, but &#8230; What did I really want to say? Why will it not come? What is all of this white noise?</p>
<p>Somehow, the latter has grown louder of late.</p>
<p>As a child, I began and finished many things with incredible speed, usually through a lack of consistency than any kind of real talent. Some skills remain &#8211; I can move with the grace of a dancer, but to go <em>en pointe</em> is a skill I shall always lack, after quitting aged nine. That time at least, it was not my fault; an old injury. But such things come back to haunt us, and I have rarely completed anything in full since. My parents learned quickly, not to indulge my whimsical side &#8211; it is prone to grabbing onto new interests, passing flights of fancy like the gossamer-silk of a baby spider in flight. But we all must land eventually. Boredom is my lesser enemy; envy is the <em>bete noir</em>, my main failing, turning kind regards to spite and a small-minded pettiness. But I am only stringing myself up, losing time better spent elsewhere, and it is (thankfully) not applicable to everyone. Only those I fear to lose.</p>
<p>University &#8211; I quit after nine weeks. I blamed the relapse, the lack of coherency in the course. The truth is, I was afraid, as ever, of change. I bottled it, and let anorexia win, because the timetable was hectic and I was unable to engage in &#8220;behaviours&#8221;. So it goes that, in a slow process of erosion, I have tried many things over the years, and quit out of higher sense of duty to an illness that lives in my brain, subsidizing a life.</p>
<p>I have lose count of the opportunities walked away from, out of fear and self-destruction. God knows where I might be now, with a little more education and ten years of living something closer to a life, under my well-notched belt. A continuous conflict between what I would like to be, and how to get there (since childhood, this certainly predates the illness), with a short attention span and aversion to rules, but a desperate desire to know the world. To read its features and hear its people, and to stay still long enough to show that I actually give a damn.</p>
<p>But if I can recognize these things, why have I not made changes? Why continue to feed the monster?<br />
When does an illness become a lifestyle?</p>
<p>So if you really want to know why I lack motivation and focus, why I do not put my (not inconsiderable) range of skills &#8211; shallow graves that they are &#8211; to better use, look no further than this.<br />
I am a Tryer, rarely a Doer. Much of what I actually manage to achieve is down to sheer blind luck, and the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p>So, stumbling from one plus to a negative, one mood and one day to another year&#8230; that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll find me, in late 2014, with as much focus as Pot Noodles and a chestful of hopes and a headful of fears, and a heart &#8230; made for lions. Because, with all of this out of the way, I am still proud. I danced ballet, and it welds steel to your bones, laces pearls into your hair.<br />
I do not stop trying. Not because &#8220;they&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8221; will have won, but because I&#8217;ve nothing better to do. Incidentally, that is what brought me around to recovery.<br />
There&#8217;s your motivational poster for the day.</p>
<p>Now I guess I&#8217;d better sleep. I&#8217;m supposed to be at work in about an hour. Sometimes, the words won&#8217;t wait, and it&#8217;s then that I know I&#8217;m a writer yet. Holding a compass.</p>

		<p>I knew where I was going, once. Had some sort of a plan, a topic, a novel, a vision &#8211; and a hell of a lot of rum.</p>
<p>Now, I have two children who are not mine, who I adore but would like to press Mute on for two hours in the evening &#8230; and shifts that are sapping the life out of my mind. Blah fucking blah. Same old story.</p>
<p>I want to get out of here. See Germany, see France, Belgium, Austria, mountains chained into diamond teeth, a hard blue sky and fierce-scented forests. I want to break out of this block that holds my head like a vice, out of &#8211; what &#8211; weariness? Spite at myself? Fear of failure?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same song on repeat. My past never left, and hunts me still. At least I sleep through the night, for now. The last bout of insomnia was a bitch. </p>
<p>Sorry, this is a protracted whinge. I can&#8217;t seem to find the words elsewhere. I use pictures to detail how I feel, and am more reliant on these than ever. It&#8217;s 8pm, and I have only just sat down.<br />
Where is this all going?</p>
<p>To sleep, with any luck.</p>
<p>Let down at work. Nothing I can go into, but suffice to say, I&#8217;m screaming into thin air. And getting through a lot of chewing gum.</p>
<p>These words at least, come easily enough. Nowhere else to lay them out, to put them down. Glance over and be gone, it&#8217;s all one to me. The other blog post will have to wait until &#8230; some kind of coherency returns.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t change my style, anymore than I can change my blood type (A-)<br />
I still walk bare foot in the rain on sunburnt tarmac, and look for the last hidden corners of the library, out of the sight of teens and away from the burring computers that riddle up my bones with current. The view from that wide-eye window is magnificent; one of the last I shall remember. The lady cathedral in dexteree, and a sprawling canvas of blue-green towards the silver ocean of sky &#8211; planes from the nearby airport, swimming with the dreaminess of carp from one cloud to another.</p>
<p>And to sinisteree, the flat rooftops where cats lollop and play, sprawl and wail, and chase with curved backs, over the baked bricks. I had a dream of following them, once, as a child. There was always time to hide in the hedges, jumping out to scare my older sister; and teaching my younger brother how to wait, silent and still, in the green-black shade of the tallest marigolds you ever saw. Three feet, those damn stems grew to. Only my mother could manage to tame so fierce a jungle in our back garden.</p>
<p>Seven trees, lined up like soldiers &#8211; one beech, three larches, two willows, and a stately grandfather oak. It was on the latter that I taught my kittens how to climb &#8211; Chloe took to it readily enough, having less fur than her sister, Jess, to weigh down small pinion-paws. Poor Jessie would take a running leap, make it halfway up the trunk (digging into the crusty bark), before flailing back down, arse first, in that inconsistent way of cats. I wished for her to have Norsk Skaukatt in her blood, if only for the long &#8220;nose-guard&#8221; profile reminiscent of the Viking helm, and that singular way of descending a tree, head-first, in a spiral, as in the way of the Nuthatch bird. </p>
<p>Certain breeds have their own peculiar traits. The Skoggy, with its spiral-descent; the Siberian, with its triple-layer fur, allowing it to become a snow-plough; the Ragdoll with its &#8220;flop&#8221;; the Siamese its shoulder-riding (although my Kai, a Birman, was also a fan of this); and my personal favourite, the Turkish Van &#8211; one of the very few felines who will readily approach water for a swim. </p>
<p>Ja, if there&#8217;s one thing I can go off on one about, it&#8217;s cats. As a kid, I collected relevant books, ornaments, toys, jewellery, fiction, poetry &#8211; wrote some of the latter myself, where did that all go? caught between the pages of some ink-stained notebook, buried in a suitcase &#8211; and pretty much lived my life in trees, down in the long grass (running from spiders), in the hope that one day I would wake, and no longer be human.</p>
<p>Still waiting.</p>
<p>This staccato voice, and aversion to loud faces, and arrogant-innocent nature, are all born out of that child&#8217;s dream. There are some mornings when I wake and watch the sky, and feel so much myself again that it seems the world had never moved on, and I had never grown and seen the patterns of my mind shift, the days blur into years. I am walking the highways again, lost in a silver-blue mist that began around my ankles and stirred up to the height of the hawthorns, and there are no thoughts of home. Of paedophiles and murderers. Of watchful, waiting eyes. Of anything beyond recall.</p>
<p>Just the night, and my feet at their softest, and ice-rimed leaves crackling still &#8211; because no human could ever learn to walk like a cat.</p>
<p>Not even the Alchemist managed that.</p>
<p>I should reread the Wild Road, really, and find myself again.</p>
<p><a href="http://raishimi33.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/the-wild-road.jpg"><img src="http://raishimi33.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/the-wild-road.jpg?w=181&#038;h=300" alt="the wild road"   class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-401" /></a></p>
<p>Well. That&#8217;ll do for now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Synaesthesia is not a product of conscious thought. Though <a href="http://www.psypost.org/2014/07/inducing-synaesthesia-can-learn-taste-smell-letter-b-26185" target="_blank">it is possible to induce a short-term effect in the minds of test subjects,</a> via hypnosis, mnemonic-training and drugs, the truth lies in the lack of consistency and prolonged reaction times between the <a href="http://quizlet.com/3180574/synesthesia-flash-cards/" target="_blank">inducer (trigger) and the concurrent (synaesthetic response.)</a> To put it another way, regarding the more commonly known grapheme-colour type, the identification of colour in a letter will differ each time, with an &#8220;a&#8221; seen as red in one instance, blue the next. Synaesthesia is closer to the involuntary actions of a cardiac muscle; we don&#8217;t tell our hearts to beat or blood to flow, yet these will occur even as we sleep, and we are aware of them through the feel of our pulse and in our conscious state. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.synesthesiatest.org/blog/synesthesia-test-variations" target="_blank">Stroop Effect</a> is used by researchers to &#8220;see if the reactions within a person&#8217;s brain are consistent with those standard in a brain altered by synesthesia.&#8221; Typically, a longer reaction time will be seen in the mind of a non-synaesthete (imagine a kick as opposed to a blink.) The Test-Retest measures consistency between inducer&#8212;&gt;concurrent: subjects are presented with a set of objects, flashcards bearing numbers and letters/words, or an audio programme without visuals, and asked to attribute these with a synaesthetic response of colour, shapes/patterns, textures, taste, personality traits, moods etc. After a set period of time, the test is reissued, with a synaesthete producing replicate results, <a href="http://www.synesthesiatest.org/blog/synesthesia-test-variations" target="_blank">&#8220;as they&#8217;ve already made neural associations which are automatic and consistent.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>The answer then lies not in preference, but in a reflexive response. It&#8217;s also true of synaesthesia that, with <a href="http://synaesthesia.com/en/workshop/syn-bewusstsein/" target="_blank">increased awareness, its strength can be intensified</a>. This was my experience last year, when I could finally put a name to what was causing all of the colours and shapes in my mind, in relation to sounds, letters, numbers and &#8211; more recently discovered &#8211; moods. I had experienced flecks of synaesthesia, in conjunction with sounds and some written words, since childhood, and had assumed everyone saw the world as I did. Now, it&#8217;s possible to distinguish one particular &#8220;mood&#8221; from another by the colour that defines it, like strata-nimbus layering up the sky as forewarning of storms, or wispy cirrus on brighter days. This is most likely through an increased awareness of what I&#8217;m &#8220;looking&#8221; at.</p>
<p>I did at first attribute every reaction to grapheme/tonal synaesthesia, but this couldn&#8217;t explain how I was also able to perceive moods in colour, independent of text or sounds. Further research showed that an <a href="http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/case-of-colour-emotion-synaesthesia.html" target="_blank">emotion-based type</a> does indeed exist. It&#8217;s possible for a synaesthete to present more than one type, often without realizing it, much as we experience <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264748" target="_blank">crossmodal correspondences</a> to enhance our awareness of surroundings (think of a cat phlegming the air, using both taste and smell, as well as sight, to map out relevant features of its territory.) </p>
<p>On top of all this are the actual means of manifestation, through internal or external perception. An <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15535169" target="_blank">associator-synaesthete</a> will find their concurrent is based in the mind, as of an awareness, like ink sifting through water, while a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2010/05/07/different-types-of-synaesthetic-experiences-involve-different-brain-mechanisms/" target="_blank">projector</a> will find synaesthesia in the world around them, as colours in letters or shapes moving around their body in connection with sound. </p>
<p>For my part, synaesthesia presents itself in indistinct form behind my eyes &#8211; I&#8217;m an associator. A grapheme won&#8217;t be defined in clear-cut lines, but I am aware of its inherent colour all the same; just as I know that singer Cat Power has a smoky-purple voice, and the colour of loss is milky-violet. It is an awareness of changes in light and darkness, a shape seen out of the corner of the eye. A sun-dial shadow moving silently over the plate. A painting in Tonalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/nocturne.jpg"><img src="http://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/nocturne.jpg?w=474" alt="nocturne"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/whis/hd_whis.htm" target="_blank">James McNeill Whistler</a>, &#8220;Nocturne &#8211; Blue and Silver &#8211; Battersea Reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly no expert in neuroscience, but curiosity about the syndrome has led me to wander from one theoretical idea to another, linking proven facts relative to the brain, to what is known of synaesthesia through objective tests, research and subjective reports. Of particular interest is the chance of there being a deeper interaction between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_modality" target="_blank">sensory modalities</a> for a heightened synaesthetic response, like weaving orchestral instruments into a symphony. In my experience, reading aloud from a book can stimulate colours in sight and hearing, as well as evoke colouration in a mood. Do these always stand independently of one another, or can they mingle to create a stronger impression? </p>
<p>One theory holds that &#8220;<a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/imaging-of-connectivity-in-the-synaesthetic-brain/" target="_blank">synaesthetes have unusual connections between different sensory regions of the cerebral cortex</a>, perhaps because of a failure to prune improper, under-used or redundant synaptic connections during development of the nervous system.&#8221; If what has come before sounded like gobbledigook, this one&#8217;s a clanger. It basically means that, in the creation of synaesthetic brains, some wires were leftover between important sensory regions; this allows unusual crossovers to occur between sight and sound, smell and memory, mood and touch. The cerebral cortex is responsible for information processing &#8211; everything from <a href="http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/a/aa032505a.htm" target="_blank">thinking, perceiving, producing and understanding language</a> &#8211; and is divided into <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/biopsychology/ss/brainstructure_2.htm" target="_blank">lobes</a>, each of which has a specific function for governing areas of response and interpretation. These are the important regions, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse" target="_blank">synaptic connections</a> are the wires. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.synesthesia.info/Ward-04.pdf" target="_blank">rather brilliant study</a> of emotional-synaesthesia, goes some way towards supporting the theory of a &#8220;candidate region&#8230; implicated in both emotion and memory,&#8221; playing host to my own colour-associative experiences of mood, and certain letters/numbers. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812579" target="_blank">retrosplenial cortex</a> is &#8220;known to respond both to personally familiar people relative to unfamiliar people, and to emotional words relative to neutral words&#8230; Its location in the medial-posterior region of the brain also makes it an attractive candidate to interface with visual regions.&#8221; Which would explain how I am able to sense an internal response, while filtering out &#8220;neutral words&#8221; (and presumably sounds) with no emotional salience &#8211; could this be the reason that I have a strong reaction to letters &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;e&#8221;, because they happen to make up my own name &#8211; Rachael?</p>
<p>A study conducted in 2010 by Romke Rouwe and H. Steven Scholte of the University of Amsterdam, saw the recruitment of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2010/05/07/different-types-of-synaesthetic-experiences-involve-different-brain-mechanisms/" target="_blank">&#8220;16 projector and 26 associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes&#8221;</a>, who were each placed in a brain scanner and &#8220;shown letters and numbers to evoke synaesthetic experiences.&#8221; Of the structural and functional aspects tested, one striking difference between the brains of the two types lay in the volume of grey matter density of particular areas. Projectors were seen to have increased levels in the visual and auditory regions, the activation of which caused the perception of &#8220;real objects&#8230; letters and numbers, to evoke the vivid experience of colours in external space.&#8221; </p>
<p>Associators, on the other hand, were seen to have increased grey matter in the hippocampus and surrounding areas known to be &#8220;critical for the formation of autobiographical, semantic and spatial memories.&#8221; The <a href="http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/p/hippocampus.htm" target="_blank">hippocampus</a> is involved in connecting &#8220;emotions and senses, such as smell and sound, to memories&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s the wonderful nostalgia found in the smell of frying bacon on a golden morning, or the wind-rush excitement that spikes up the skin, evoked by the spice of pine needles. The location of the hippocampus, in the temporal lobe &#8211; itself responsible for the <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/biopsychology/ss/brainstructure_2.htm" target="_blank">interpretation of sounds and language</a> -gives a boost to the possibility of a crossover occurring via &#8220;unpruned&#8221; synaptic connections, in the brain of an Associator. Furthermore, it would allow for a range of synaesthetic experiences, perhaps activated simultaneously by the same stimuli, for that &#8220;symphonic&#8221; effect. It would certainly help to explain how I am able to experience writing, music and other inducers, on a multi-sensual level.</p>
<p>It is noted in the study that this region, with its wholly internal perceptions, would resemble &#8220;memory retrieval&#8221;, in that letters and numbers would only evoke &#8220;recollections of the experience of colours, rather than vivid impressions of the colours themselves.&#8221; This goes back to the issue of recall v.s. actual sense-crossovers, and would lead me to question the validity of my own experiences &#8230;  were it not for the undeniable presence of colours in relation to moods, as well as the additional (and consistent) features found in inducers, such as texture, personality traits and spatial awareness. These are all experienced on such a unique, nuanced and involuntary level, especially where there is strong emotional resonance, that I find it difficult to attribute each one only to memory-recall. But the study does serve to highlight the crucial differences in construct, for understanding how one synaesthetic mind will differ from another in practise. Variations between regions of the brain that are stimulated, will dictate whether an internal or external effect is produced.</p>
<p>Timing will also differ between the two types, based on interference between actual visual perceptions, and the external synaesthetic responses of a projector. While a grapheme-colour associator would read a coloured letter and find their concurrent &#8220;in the mind&#8217;s eye&#8221;, a projector would take longer to identify what they are seeing in the external world, as evidenced in Stroop tests, when a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2010/05/07/different-types-of-synaesthetic-experiences-involve-different-brain-mechanisms/" target="_blank">&#8220;colour word is printed in a colour that differs from the meaning of the word</a>&#8230; When asked to name the printed colour, the discrepancy causes longer response times and more errors, because we can read words more quickly than we can name colours.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is not to say that I don&#8217;t have my fair share of distractions and crossover-confusions. The colours of individual graphemes can be altered by the presence of a &#8216;dominant&#8217; colour in one letter (&#8220;i&#8221; is white, and has a tendency to &#8220;bleach out&#8221; other letters around it; the word &#8220;institutionalized&#8221; appears as a blind man&#8217;s stick, tall and upright), while a mood-concurrent may overwhelm a song, cancelling out the colours inherent of vocals and music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyHDBWKLzI" target="_blank">The National&#8217;s &#8220;Slipped&#8221;</a> appears in the silver-lilac of an evening sky; these are the colours of loss and longing. No instrument stands out, and vocalist Matt Berninger&#8217;s chocolate-baritone is obscured in the haze.</p>
<p><a href="http://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/lake-heart-1.jpg"><img src="http://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/lake-heart-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="Lake heart 1" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-98" /></a></p>
<p>Some prominent grapheme-colour features:<br />
a = navy blue<br />
ae = blue-green<br />
c = canary yellow<br />
ch = canary yellow<br />
e = green<br />
h = kelly green<br />
i = white<br />
m = red<br />
o = ultramarine<br />
oo = teal / turquoise<br />
s = mint green, silver<br />
t = black<br />
u = yellow<br />
x = grey</p>
<p>3 holds very favourable connections, as its turquoise appearance has a silky sheen reminiscent of sunlight twinkling in a thousand sparkles on the ocean, or a beautiful ball gown cunningly sewn through with glitter. It is also of moderate size, neat and compact, with positive traits of independence and intelligence. 6, on the other hand, is little and silly; light green, and quite youthful. 9 is enigmatic and purple, towering-tall as a solemn older lady in heels; while 7 is brown and cheerful. 3 also runs concurrently with the letter C, which begins many of my favourite words; but in this case, the colour-perception is far less appealing, in solid canary-yellow (think of a child&#8217;s box of poster paints, or a piece of plastic.) Again, this points towards a reflexive, rather than a preferential reaction.</p>
<p>0 = no colour<br />
1 = red<br />
2 = yellow<br />
3 = turquoise<br />
4 = dark green<br />
5 = yellow<br />
6 = orange<br />
7 = brown<br />
8 = pink<br />
9 = purple<br />
10 = no colour</p>
<p>The name of my friend, Carlotta, is dark blue (&#8220;o&#8221;) and pale pink (&#8220;a&#8221;). There is no sign of canary-yellow &#8220;c&#8221;, and &#8220;a&#8221; is normally blue when beginning the alphabet; it also stands at odds with her Twitter handle, @1chae, with the consonant diagraph &#8220;ch&#8221; appearing in yellow, while somehow lightening the blue-green of &#8220;ae&#8221; into turquoise. </p>
<p>The presence of &#8220;name colours&#8221; has a mnemonic effect that&#8217;s handy for social situations &#8211; I can pin a colour/colours to people, as you would bookmark a page. Similarly, synaesthetes who experience sequence-space and colours in relation to time, are able to create an internal diary or an external calendar; in a projector type, the latter is known to appear around their bodies, with more recent dates featuring large and prominent, and later dates &#8220;further away&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, the days of the week go from left to right, and the months go round in a wheel, with January meeting December in the bottom centre. Oddly, I don&#8217;t have this for numbers. So when I think &#8220;I&#8217;m meeting Lizzie on Thursday&#8221;, my mind jumps to a low space in front of my torso, towards my right. (Thursday is brown; Lizzie is blue).&#8221; &#8211; Holly Williams, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/inside-the-sensual-world-of-the-synaesthetes-i-can-smell-a-rainbow-9624183.html" target="_blank">&#8220;I can smell a Rainbow.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>The texture of a letter can be altered between its written and spoken forms, with certain phonemes silvering-up words that would otherwise have a matte or solid appearance. The sibilance found in &#8220;city&#8221;, &#8220;cerulean&#8221; and &#8220;strata&#8221;, for example, whittles their shape down to something delicate, like a crystal glass or fine-link chain; at odds with the boldness of phoneme /k/ in &#8220;cat&#8221;, &#8220;clover&#8221; and &#8220;kill.&#8221; It&#8217;s for this reason that I consider words based in Old French to be of paler hue and lighter substance than those of Germanic origin, which appear more jagged.</p>
<p>While a lower pitch equates a darker tone, the colour of a voice or instrument will not change; a swift climb up the scales produces a narrowed effect and lighter shade. Should one instrument take precedence over others, an overlay of colours may appear, as with the ostrich guitar in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c" target="_blank">Velvet Underground&#8217;s &#8220;Venus in Furs&#8221;</a> &#8211; those brass flares claw at the smoky teal background like forked lightning over a midnight sky. The two colours stand out, distinct from one another, yet the image is still wholly internal; there are no external projections onto the world around me.</p>
<p>Timbre dictates shape, with folk singer Nick Drake&#8217;s voice appearing in the rounded fluidity of an oboe, rippling green as river water, occasionally gritty with oak bark. Canadian singer Leslie Feist appears in pale mint-green, woven through with striations of darker and lighter shades, in a texture best described as &#8220;tethered&#8221; &#8211; a matte, frayed-edge appearance, as of a strip of papyrus or woven cloth. A broader stroke (e.g. a guitar chord or throaty voice) produces a wider sweep of the brush in a range of shades, while a single monotonous note or thin/quiet voice appears in the trail of a fine-tipped watercolour pencil.</p>
<p>As a general rule, music I would file under &#8220;wandering / nostalgic&#8221; &#8211; almost invariably in minor key &#8211; will appear in colours evocative of the bittersweet tang found in a sunset, regardless of unique instrumental and vocal features. Gold, brass, copper, cream, honey, fawn: twisted scrap metal, the jagged hues of a landlocked barge; the haze of an early autumn sky, the sepia tones of an old photograph. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhL8OMursQM" target="_blank">Mogwai&#8217;s &#8220;Too Raging to Cheers&#8221;</a> is one such song, reminscent of a fiery day&#8217;s end, wandering an abandoned railway line, smelling the thick richness of oil leaking from heat-baked sleepers, listening to the scrunch of gravel underfoot, the bony clatter of weeds in the wind.</p>

<p>When depression begins its slow creep-crawl through my head, I know of its presence through the gradual fading-out of all colours. While this can happen in connection with weariness or low blood sugar, a prolonged state of &#8220;pale mind&#8221; is a signal for me to look around at circumstances, experiences; if I&#8217;m not pushing the buck with excessive exercise or lack of rest, something else is at work. In similar fashion, a stark &#8220;whiteout&#8221; represents real fear and/or shock, caught in the camera flash of a moment. This reaction has been known to intrude on actual visual perceptions, much as someone suffering with a migraine would find it difficult to see properly. Other synaesthetes have reported similar instances of their concurrent producing a warning signal:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I was a child I have had vivid visual images in response to fearful or uncomfortable thoughts. Intense ones, that is. The fear-induced images take the form of highly wrinkled bluish-greenish paper moving around in an irregular pattern. It’s a whole landscape. Sometimes the images consist in large quantities of quickly presented irregular and wrinkled pieces of bluish-greenish cloth moving around very quickly. Not all of my uncomfortable or fearful thoughts are associated with this sort of phenomenology but the occurrence of this kind of phenomenology is a sure sign of uncomfortable or scary thoughts.&#8221; &#8211; Berit Brogaard, DMSci, PhD and Kristian Marlow, <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201212/mixing-the-senses-green-3s-purple-pain-and-blue-fear" target="_blank">&#8220;The Superhuman Mind: Cases of extraordinary mental ability.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I always know when a feral mood is coming on. It&#8217;s in the glossiness of a raven&#8217;s wing or a beetle&#8217;s back; the purple-blackness of a forest full of thorns and silent trees, all shot through with the pale claws of the moon that lick off dark eyes. It&#8217;s the wilder side we try to conceal from the grey reality of Everyday. It&#8217;s an amalgamation of those raw emotions that are rich as soil and hard to deny. It&#8217;s the source of my insomniac nights, spent wandering the orange-splintered lamplight haven, kicking up old leaves. It&#8217;s the hot hard feeling in the back of the throat, the burning eyes and iron-grin, when reading something that fills you with a sudden savage desire to act &#8211; to run, fuck, claw the walls. Sometimes it appears without any prompting at all. When I&#8217;m at work, it&#8217;s best to keep my head down. Left unfulfilled, it can fall into a nimbus-mood, which is closer to repressed anger and a bad mood.</p>
<p><a href="https://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beetle-black.jpg"><img src="http://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beetle-black.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="beetle black" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-134" /></a></p>
<p>For all of these words and theories, I still have no clear idea as to the origins of the synaesthesia that colours up my mind. Perhaps it&#8217;s better this way, wandering through the half-light, in unfinished lines of what-might-be. All I can be sure of is the consistency. Even when talking with another chromosthete (sound&#8212;&gt;colour), I would find discrepancies between our reactions; particularly if they happen to be a projector-type, able to watch the flux-flow of colours and patterns externally. My internal perceptions are as much a focus of life as the normal five senses, and &#8211; as a writer &#8211; it&#8217;s priceless in figurative language. I can simulate (and stimulate) versions of what I perceive, through sensory crossovers that will allow a non-synaesthete to know how a word relative to cold may appear blue, how a situation full of tension can be tasted in the iron-tang air. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cover my own influences in the next blog post. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This synaesthetic mind is usually sparking over with some colour-pattern or another, some form of mood, passing like the lowering nimbus that follow the spine of the Beacon; or flicker-flaring like shafts of golden light that dance across the wings of white gliders and red kites, angling over the Downs.</p>
<p>When feelings are blunted, through writer&#8217;s block, depression or illness, the colours become muted shades. Imagine the negative of a photograph, and you&#8217;re close. I&#8217;ve yet to put my finger on why or how this happens, but am aware of it as a creeping sensation, as of whitewash bleeding down a wall. Clarity loses its edge; sharp lines are blurred into a &#8220;porthole&#8221; effect, which in its turn creates a rather narrowed scope of the world. Emotions follow suit (or perhaps it&#8217;s the emotional &#8220;whiteout&#8221; that leads), paling into a blank space that is neither up nor down, high nor low. Just &#8230; there. </p>
<p>And not much of a &#8220;there&#8221;, either.</p>
<p>I prefer to feel, even if it is a black hole of a mood. This nothingness is like burning the tongue, losing all sensation of texture and taste. Music that once lifted the hairs on my arms, now appears as flat colours of the mind, once so vibrant in accompaniment as they danced in silver-fine threads, or strident bars of mahogany, cream and ochre. </p>
<p>(The bowed guitar of Sigur Ros&#8217; &#8220;Rafstraumur&#8221;, is an excellent example of the latter.)</p>
<p>I have to step away from the world for a time &#8211; at least, the sociable one. Cutting off all contact, speaking few words beyond politeness for a day or so, I follow the inevitable trail of childhood back to old influences. The people whose work first coloured my mind, washing it through with a sluice of paint; books and music, art. TV programmes. The sort of things that are best appreciated alone, no matter how much your fingers may itch to exact their details on social media, in imagery or images. </p>
<p>Believe me, I&#8217;ve tried. It can never have the same effect. It&#8217;s like trying to portray the heartbeat of a Rothko painting in a postcard. Nothing captures that eerie sensation of life within a canvas, until you&#8217;ve done it yourself &#8211; stood behind the blasted rope that keeps you from touching eternity (maybe a saving grace after all, for such disappointment would live in knowing that it really is only whorls of hard paint), and felt the walls breathe, seen the colours ripple. </p>
<p>The room goes silent and still. Your eyes slide down to the floor, upward and across &#8211; unable to look at the damn thing straight on, because it holds a gentle laugh at your own futility, mortality. </p>
<p>I have a quiet grin myself, now, remembering that room. Its light made of living shadows, maroon and purple and black.</p>
<p>The truth, I suppose, is that I need to break out more. To step away from these lines. It&#8217;s too easy to become embedded in daily habits, to lose a whole year in work, and weekends, and work again. But it seems that when I stop to look around, to take a breath and feel &#8230; something else happens. I know I&#8217;m pessimistic in this. I don&#8217;t want to become chipped china.</p>
<p>Alice Hoffman. Truman Capote. F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jeffrey Eugenides. Peter .S. Beagle. Authors who hold imagery in one hand and narrative threads in the other, and somehow manage to weave the two into a sensation of near-poetic prose. I come away feeling refreshed, more myself. It&#8217;s where the disconnect-reconnect occurs. It is finding the world again, through the artistic influences that once led you to believe there was more to life -</p>
<p>Than this solid state.</p>
<p>Metaphors flourish under new light, and I take to spotting things. Clouds that resemble spilled cotton balls, a blue-steel lake; the way a skein of geese resembles a great black arrowhead. How a favourite song fills my mind with the milk-honey sweetness of an early autumn sky.<br />
(Cream and gold; you can&#8217;t tell where one ends and the other begins.)</p>
<p>And the old childhood favourites, of course &#8211; Jenny Nimmo, Brian Jacques, Robin Jarvis, Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman. The ones who taught me that nothing is beyond suspension of disbelief, so long as the threads are strong enough. I threw away so many stories, as a kid, full of anger and frustration at my own imagination. Or rather, the lack of force behind it, my own dull willpower. D&#8217;you know what is so bloody odd, so iron-tang smile now, watching the actions of Putin and the Kremlin in Russia? I wrote similar things while in my teens &#8211; younger &#8211; then binned them, because I thought no one would believe me. That such narratives would never make it onto a shelf, because no antagonist could possibly get away with cutting off a town, a country, isolating them in poverty and bleeding out minds with propaganda (though I didn&#8217;t know these terms at the time, just the basic concepts.) The authorities of the world &#8211; other countries &#8211; would surely never allow this sort of power-play to happen; it could only exist in the fantasy novels I was reading at the time.<br />
It&#8217;d never catch on. Not in the &#8220;real&#8221; world.</p>
<p>Of course, what I didn&#8217;t know then was that Brian Jacques had drawn upon the <a href="http://www.redwall.org/ideas.html" target="_blank">Second World War, as an influence for his Redwall saga.</a> And then I took an interest in history myself, and began to read backwards.</p>
<p>Typical, really.<br />
Truth -<br />
Fiction -<br />
Interchangeable.</p>
<p>More to the point &#8211; why, even then, did I give so much of a damn about what other people thought of my mind?</p>
<p>Well. That was then, this is now; and the only responsibility I will take from it all, is doing something about this paling mind. We govern our own futures.<br />
Which simply means following myself back home.</p>

		<p>So here we are, on a day and in a time when the tears fall as rain on the mountains; when the sun is all the brighter in the sky, for our knowing it is still there. Coming in through my front door this evening, to the fragrant smells of wine and paella &#8211; my landlady is a great cook, and of the kindness that is bent around caring for others, so that I am always invited to join in at meals &#8211; I felt myself to be Home. The dog was curled up by the fire; warm smells of pine went trailing golden fingers through the house. Where others are not so fortunate, and have been hounded from the place of their birth, the land where ancestral bones lie deep as legends, I can claim this place for my sanctuary.  I know a newly-learned gratitude for all that I have, those seemingly small and insignificant things, as I once knew them after coming home from hospital. But it is too easy to forget, to become complacent again.</p>
<p>The wind is already turning blue on my side of the world, with a rawness in the pale arabesque of the morning. In these tumultuous days, we are leased into softer eyes and gentler smiles; our sharp shining edges are smoothed over by empathy. Shared sorrow, frustration, anger, fear. Doubt. Confusion. And still, more fear, as we wonder &#8211; with each click and scroll &#8211; what will happen next.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 19th August, the world saw the face of its foe &#8211; what was revealed of it &#8211; hovering like a baleful moon above that of James Wright Foley, a US citizen and freelance photojournalist, captured in Syria in 2012. Though about to be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11044977/Hunt-for-British-Islamic-State-killer-of-US-journalist-James-Foley.html" target="_blank">taken by that most futile act called murder, for an even more futile cause</a>, James didn&#8217;t flinch or try to pull away. He probably knew well enough where the contents of that video would end up, how it would be used for propaganda, as a shock of reality; for the awareness of the wider world, for the threat of the same fate meted out to others. Still, his face remained set as that of a clock, dialling down on its own time.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same is true for those who have watched the grim facts of that video in full. Perhaps they too, haven&#8217;t flinched. But, whatever their agenda, it cannot even begin to be measured against James&#8217; own strength.</p>
<p>The perpetrators are more than willing to take the rest of humanity down with them, on their way to a faux-martyrdom. As James Kirkup of The Telegraph <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jameskirkup/100283539/dont-dignify-james-foleys-murder-by-calling-it-an-execution/" target="_blank">rightly pointed out</a>, to call James&#8217; death an &#8220;execution&#8221; is to give it more honour than it deserves. He was murdered, by hands and a heart too cold to know love and respect for another.</p>
<p>Walking home tonight, I found myself mulling over this, and other things that have come to pass. The blue-black cloud of inertia that had filled me up like ink sifting through water, slowly slipped away. In its place wove a silver thread of desperate hope, twined about with the pale green of worry &#8230; a thin petrol-rainbow of fear.</p>
<p>Passing through our local Muslim community, I found myself faced with the troubled faces and downcast eyes that are sadly reminiscent of other times. Such fear is palpable, like the wavering heat rising from a radiator. 9/11. 7/7. 22/5. Numbers that would be meaningless, without the context of death and tragedy, of atrocities carried out in the name of Islam; when it is the innocent followers of that faith who must bear the fallout. As though they had any part in it at all. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/11047487/Indonesia-president-says-Islamic-State-embarrassing-Muslims.html" target="_blank">&#8220;We do not tolerate it, we forbid ISIS in Indonesia</a>&#8230; This is a new wake-up call to international leaders all over the world, including Islamic leaders&#8230; [to] review how to combat extremism. Changing paradigms on both sides are needed &#8211; how the West perceives Islam and how Islam perceives the West.&#8221; &#8211; Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, president of Indonesia.</p>
<p>I remember the face of my friend, who once walked the beat as a hate-crime officer, giving a sympathetic ear and trustworthy pledge of hope to those he served in the Muslim community; and his words, full of sadness, telling me of the young sons and daughters taken by shadows of fear; the mothers and fathers left behind, bewildered and terrified for their children. For each other.</p>
<p>I read the <a href="http://nillunasserstelter.com/2014/08/19/violence-and-complicity/" target="_blank">latest blog entry</a> of my dear friend Nillu, who is a Shia Ismaili Muslim, and the fear becomes personal; it becomes a pale rim around my vision, half-thinking about what is best left unsaid, unknown. The future is what happens when it arrives, not what we try to foresee. She is Nillu, one of the loveliest and most empathetic women I have ever known, and the thought that anyone might think negative thoughts of her, based upon her religion, burns out my mind. She is the peace of her faith, personified.</p>
<p>I recall how on Monday, when our worlds met at the borderline of thought and dream, I had told my other beloved friend Amira that, while the little things matter in this life, the finer details, we cannot escape the Here and Now, how this affects us. When we hit those patches of black ice, nothing is so very important than to get the words down before the usual inertia of getting-by steers us back towards equilibrium. How else would we know, how else would we remember what had hit us hard? (Sometimes, it really is a case of diving into the nearest cafe or stairwell, to record a piece of existence that would otherwise go unnoticed, dropped like a coin into a well; a brief glitter, then blackness.)</p>
<p>To which she agreed, as ever she would, for we are alike as twins in mindset.  Her <a href="http://artz3.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/standwithferguson/" target="_blank">own blog entry</a> wrapped itself about the anger and fear felt for Ferguson, a suburb in her hometown of  St Louis. While the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/orderly-protests-continue-in-ferguson-as-troops-leave/2424366.html" target="_blank">tension has since begun to unwind</a>, Amira&#8217;s entry &#8211; posted  in lieu of a literary article about fiction and publishing &#8211; told its own story of the immediacy of that situation, how it caught and affected her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screw that blog post I wrote about literature and fiction – it can wait. There are more important things at stake right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, for all this &#8211; for all my waffle and whimsy in attempting to make sense of what I and others have witnessed, day by day, on rolling news feeds and carefully edited images &#8211; from the scene of James Foley&#8217;s last moments, and the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4426dc70-29de-11e4-914f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3B9F0OCun" target="_blank">ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine</a> &#8211; I find myself, at the end of this day, so full of dark thoughts &#8230; and somehow still willing to get up and try again. For a smile and a prayer, at least.</p>
<p>Entering the cathedral for a walk between those dark-wood polished pews, drifting with the dust motes that are like so many silver sparks, I spoke aloud the words and cried the tears held back all day. I commended his memory to whoever might have been listening, anyone or no one. I have no particular faith. I just walk where there is peace to be found, between cool marble columns etched over with long-ago dates and names, upon rainbow-glitter sprays flung from the stained glass windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cathedral-girl.jpg"><img src="http://lamplighthaven.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cathedral-girl.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="cathedral girl" width="300" height="224" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30" /></a></p>
<p>James, I didn&#8217;t know you, or your family. But you symbolized what I want to be, what I want to achieve, and it&#8217;s for this reason that I take <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/11045174/Its-not-worth-your-life-James-Foleys-warning-to-future-journalists.html" target="_blank">your words</a> to heart, more than most.<br />
You had your romantic ideals discoloured by reality, and still carried on. For that, no act of inhumanity can diminish your memory.</p>
<p>Following an unpleasant encounter with an unedited photograph taken from a jihadist Twitter account &#8211; tossed about with the carelessness of a tennis ball, among people who ought to have known better than to give the perpetrators the notoriety they seek &#8211; I decided to find out more about graphic content, its origins and uses. The principle focus was on how this type of media fits into the growing scope of social networking, as an instantaneous publisher. With the rise of portable technology, we have nothing to fear in terms of missing a moment in the world. What we have to fear instead, is the decrease in ethical judgement when it comes to sharing what we have found &#8211; live, unedited, raw footage, often taken from conflict zones and scenes of tragic events, passed about to &#8230; what? Inspire retaliation? Instil dread? The lines grow blurred. What is useful propaganda to one party, is click-bait to another; and to still others, it is a symbolic vocalization of what cannot be described in words. Though I do wish more people would try. For that matter, <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1321744/twitter-to-remove-gory-photos-of-death" target="_blank">Twitter has at least started cracking down on graphic content</a>, and is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11039900/Twitter-suspends-Islamic-State-accounts.html" target="_blank">actively suspending accounts which would use it for propaganda and intimidation.</a></p>
<p>For all that I am a writer, with words supposedly my weapons (and you would think, some kind of clarity), metaphors and symbolism are all too often my fall-back. Such is the delight of Twitter, with its reams of information-imagery and algorithms, that I am never short of those stars for a constellation of emotional expression. A picture can sum up far more than I could put into words. That being said, I pull up short before pressing any buttons on the sort of content that has become an unpleasant side effect of following certain topics, in order to learn more. I&#8217;ll confess now, my fingers have itched. Some images have sent my mind down into a blankness that only long hours of walking, and missing a meal &#8211; startling my body awake with hunger &#8211; could shred. For long moments, I pause, wanting to show those who follow me &#8211; &#8220;Look. Look at this. Look at what these people who are not people, have done to this woman, this man, this child. Did you ever think that blood could run so thickly, that it turns black?&#8221;</p>
<p>But no. Because why should I be so selfish as to pretend there isn&#8217;t a sneaking voyeuristic pleasure-horror to be gained out of seeing others&#8217; reactions? Or is it that I want to stand a mirror up between us to find the same emotions, the same words, to know that what I have seen is real, and not the darkest nightmare?</p>
<p>Oh, I still long to show you all, to make you understand how terrible the suffering was of those people &#8230; But I don&#8217;t know it myself, because I wasn&#8217;t there, and I didn&#8217;t experience it. I know nothing of the situation, but what I&#8217;ve seen from a tiny set of pixels in a frame, holding the last image of a person who was alive and breathing once, beloved, longed for, educated, born. That picture, that video, is but a fragment of who they were. Whatever the perpetrators of their death thought to gain in taking that last image, or allowing it to be taken, to be passed around on social networking sites, they can&#8217;t diminish these facts.</p>
<p>So why, then, should I have been so upset to see that image &#8211; the first piece of graphic media I had come across on Twitter &#8211; treated the way that it was, transferred from one user to another, to illustrate the point of the murderer&#8217;s violence?<br />
Ah, there&#8217;s the paradox. I guess I would call it &#8220;dignity in death.&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/james-foley-daily-horrors-internet-think-clicking-beheading?CMP=twt_gu" target="_blank">This article</a> from the Guardian, summed up what I have been trying to spit out for weeks about the perks and perils of sharing graphic content on social networking sites. Blogs such as <a href="http://www.leguape.com/journalism/the-hazards-of-war-reporting-from-the-other-side-of-the-world" target="_blank">this one</a>, written by BBC journalist Alex Murray, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/dealing-with-graphic-content-is-a-moral-minefield-for-journalists-30383" target="_blank">this on</a> <em>The Conversation</em>, have helped me to see both sides of the flipped coin. Because I want to know how it feels to face that kind of reality, when it&#8217;s all caught in pixels on a screen in the newsroom, with only a hand to reach out and no way of changing the ending. I want to know, so I can better understand it.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/dealing-with-graphic-content-is-a-moral-minefield-for-journalists-30383" target="_blank">&#8220;Whether or not a news organisation is right to use graphic material is a matter of opinion.</a> But what this article has hopefully illustrated is that in certain cases the decisions to print or broadcast are taken with care and with a genuine desire to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217;. The mainstream media, if we can speak so generally, has its multitude of failings. But let’s not forget that when dealing with upsetting and harrowing imagery, journalists do not exist in a vacuum, unencumbered by the moral uncertainties that we all face.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; John Jewell,<br />
Director of Undergraduate Studies, School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies at Cardiff University.</p>
<p>We are all beholden to each other&#8217;s goodwill and ethical standards, on social networking sites &#8211; it&#8217;s a push-pull system of give and take. Each of us have a duty of care to our friends and followers, who come from diverse socio-cultural and religious backgrounds. In cyberspace, after all, there are fewer limitations on what can be seen; it is difficult to erase certain things from under the eyelids.<br />
And we are not even on the ground as witnesses, feeling the <em>whump</em> of explosives and feeling the sting of heat, or handling raw footage for editing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That much of this material is shot point of view and handheld does have an impact. When this sort of video is edited, it’s pretty easy to treat it simply as &#8216;material&#8217;. When it is a single continuous shot, there is something about its unified perspective – as the point of view of a real person, not of a piece of a broadcast – that can be difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t journalists trying to sort facts and report &#8216;the story&#8217;, this is people showing you what they are experiencing, as if to say: <br />
&#8216;I don’t understand why this is happening. Why are they doing this to us? If I show you, then perhaps someone will explain what is going on.'&#8221; &#8211; Alex Murray, <a href="http://www.leguape.com/journalism/the-hazards-of-war-reporting-from-the-other-side-of-the-world" target="_blank">&#8220;The Hazards of war reporting from the other side of the world.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>While graphic media, submitted by citizens as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/terms/faq.shtml" target="_blank">user-generated content</a>, can be used to raise awareness &#8211; drawing in a wider audience to the <a href="http://m.ceip.org/publications/?fa=56392" target="_blank">fracture-lines appearing in our world</a>, and bringing to bear the reality of life under conflict &#8211; it is also known for its white-out effect of desensitization. There is the Long Blink of ignorance left in bliss &#8211; which none of us has the right to deny another, for our individual worlds are populated by enough troubles &#8211; or the self-propagating cycle of seeking out yet stronger content, more brutal scenes, to achieve the same effect. Then there is the consideration of safety for those with the means to produce such content.</p>
<p>&#8220;The temptation is to be out at the very front with them &#8211; where the fighting is more dramatic, more filmic. Front-line reporting &#8211; capturing and communicating the essence of war &#8211; is always a gamble, but one where we think we can set the odds&#8230; The further forward you go, the more powerful the pictures, but the greater the chances of being killed or injured. Our flak jackets and helmets are far from invincible. As a cub reporter I was always told never to become the story.&#8221; &#8211; Alastair Leithead, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15007787" target="_blank">&#8220;Hazards of war reporting from the Libyan front line.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Journalists now constantly have to make difficult decisions about protecting the safety of people caught up in these events&#8230; But being aware of the need to do this doesn&#8217;t always come naturally if you&#8217;re not used to reporting wars from the newsroom.<br />
What about the monitoring of phone calls or even email traffic?<br />
What language can be used to identify yourself without endangering the contributor?<br />
How do we introduce ourselves?<br />
Is Gmail safer than Hotmail?&#8221; &#8211; Matthew Eltringham, Editor of the BBC College of Journalism website; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/blogcollegeofjournalism/posts/The-new-frontline-is-inside-the-newsroom2" target="_blank">&#8220;The new frontline is inside the newsroom.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>James Foley had the backing of the GlobalPost, based in Boston, but took no fewer risks than his peers. His death brings up again what freelance journalists face when reporting from warzones, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/20/how-journalists-like-james-foley-fall-victim-to-worlds-most-dangerous-conflict-to-report/" target="_blank">&#8220;lightly resourced, laughably paid, almost wholly uninsured&#8230; often armed with little more than a notebook and a mobile phone.&#8221;</a> There has been particular focus on Syria, where James was taken, which has been labelled <a href="http://www.cpj.org/2014/08/cpj-condemns-killing-of-american-journalist-james-.php" target="_blank">&#8220;the most dangerous country in the world for journalists&#8221;</a> to work in, by The Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.cpj.org/2014/08/cpj-condemns-killing-of-american-journalist-james-.php" target="_blank">At least 69 other journalists</a> have been killed covering the conflict there, including some who died over the border in Lebanon and Turkey. More than 80 journalists have been kidnapped in Syria; with frequent abductions, some of which go unpublicized, it is difficult to know exactly how many. CPJ estimates that approximately 20 journalists, both local and international, are currently missing in Syria. Many of them are believed to be held by Islamic State.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still have a petrol-rainbow trickle of an idea about what I would like to do in the near future. There are big decisions to be made. But more and more, with each turning leaf and golden bar of sunlight turning to brass, with each red-rim eye of a news story, I find my thoughts turning to my family. I see the bravery of the Foleys &#8211; read his<a href="http://gawker.com/james-foleys-mother-speaks-out-we-have-never-been-pro-1624251219" target="_blank"> mother&#8217;s words</a> &#8211; and must now think on such things as consequences. For all that I have no further responsibilities or ties, other than my current job, there are still those left behind to consider.</p>
<p>There is only so much the human mind can take, before it must shutter down and shine out. I end my days now, after online research,by turning my phone off and sticking my head into an Alice Hoffman book. It&#8217;s this, or break under the heavy iron band stretched over my skull, leaving its tang in my throat, a soreness around my eyes.</p>
<p>There are always those sparks of drifting dust &#8211; our histories, our lives &#8211; to call us back. The beautiful smile of a friend, tweeting a picture of herself with family; the unique charm of a compliment for a posted story. The fluffed fur of a kitten with ocean eyes, caught in a noir photo; the lingering words of one who lies on the peripheral line where the sky meets the sea. The pleasant swatch of colours found in a tweet describing the morning-sounds of birds on the feeder, and bacon on the stove. </p>
<p>For all that the blood is a book, to be read over and again in the hopes of learning from our pasts &#8230; we live for the future, and it is Now. So while sharing the seemingly mundane, the cheerful, the cherished, we take our stand against those who would spread only darkness. When we speak of the dead, those taken from us in the most diabolical ways, let it be with images of who they really were &#8211; the people who lived, worked, spoke and fought for freedom, ours and theirs; for knowledge, for one more assignment, for one more day. In using hashtags like #ISISmediablackout and #StopPutin, we set our faces to the changing winds of tomorrow &#8211; denying the murderers and the liars the voices that would continue the fear and oppression &#8211; while remembering that today is for Us, and the memories of those who are gone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only when we stem the creativity, the playful tweets, the Good Mornings, the most wire-grin banter, that the perpetrators of that insidious fear have won.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s me done. Hope I haven&#8217;t inadvertently offended anyone or left something important out; if I have, drop me a line and I&#8217;ll apologise. Otherwise, it&#8217;s</p>
<p><em>Guten nacht</em></p>
<p>from me.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A close friend of mine is, these days, trying hard to understand why there is so much noise on the social media and wonders if it achieves any purpose for the development of the country. He particularly referred to the latest incident involving a famous Indian journalist who is currently having a rather tough time in the US. My friend believes both sides are at fault but he really cannot appreciate what the NaMo supporters achieve by fighting that journalist and tweeting against him and shouldn&#8217;t they rather just do some constructive criticism of the government.
</p>
<p>Many people might ask the same question. Is there much to achieve from outraging against the journalists? And does it really help the development of the nation. The short answer is: Yes. There is tremendous merit in battling anyone you feel is trying to set some narrative which may be contrary to yours. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a war between ideologies. One ideology is that of hypocrisy and tighter government controls, and the other is that of good governance and free economy. Both sides come loaded with multitude of other phenomena. And the country works according to which ideology becomes dominant.
</p>
<p>Currently, it is the center right ideology which is dominant and the social media played a big role in making it dominant since social media influences the influencers and forces people to think empathize with a point of view.
</p>
<p>This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>An incident occurs which has the potential to turn into an ideological battle.
</li>
<li>Side A makes one kind of noise
</li>
<li>Side B makes another kind of noise.
</li>
<li>In the end, whichever side wins, influences public opinion in its favor. This occurs through influencers present on the social media who keenly observe the patterns that emerge within the noise.
</li>
<li>This eventually translates into electoral dividend when elections come.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The sum total of ideological wars that occur on the social media directly make an impact on a large population. The recent journalist incident was one small battle in this much larger war.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, if left liberals start winning these ideological battles more often, they would eventually win the war and we can be sure that UPA 3 will be back in India. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;">J</span></p>

			<p><a href="http://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/narendra_modi-621x414-621x414.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1454 aligncenter" src="http://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/narendra_modi-621x414-621x414.jpg?w=700" alt="narendra_modi--621x414--621x414"   /></a>The world seems to be going deep into chaos with internal conflicts happening in the Arab world, Pakistan and Ukraine. After 9/11 it was widely expected that the US would go after the Jehadist forces. It did so but was criticized for its misadventure in Iraq. In hindsight, it did prove to be a monumental blunder considering Saddam Hussein’s regime was probably heaven compared to the situation that has emerged in Iraq now. The US did not finish the job in Iraq when it left it in 2011. Similarly, it appears that the US is going to leave Afghanistan to its fate as well. And what’s even more interesting is that the Americans don’t seem too bothered with these stands. This suggests that a time has come when the Americans seem to getting weary of all the conflicts they have got themselves involved in. And when the US seems more interested in empowering the Iraqis to deal with the ISIS situation themselves but is reluctant to send her own soldiers, the message gets even more clear: “We are done.” .(Check out the video below)</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/spIWGoNZnaU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=261&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></div>
<p>Today, Obama is seen as a world leader, a title the American head of the state automatically assumes as soon as he is elected, who is weak and indecisive. And this has created a vacuum in world leadership where there does not seem to be anyone in particular the world can look up to solve the common problems of humanity.</p>
<p>While it will be highly immature to dismiss the US’s superpower status, three very solid and ambitious world leaders have emerged who seem extremely interested in occupying the aforementioned leadership vacuum, the world is witnessing right now. While on the one hand there is Vladimir Putin from Russia who has of late shown expansionist tendencies, on the other, there is Xi Jinping of China who is the leader of the emerging super power, a super power which is largely loathed by the world. Things seem to have changed though, for the world at large, ever since Narendra Modi got elected as the Prime Minister of India.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/0zNTZMdQ1Hg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></div>
<p>Modi seems to be fast emerging as a leader who is immensely likeable, has strong convictions, is extremely business friendly and is someone who seems to show a lot of concern for the world. This was very much evident from his speech in Nepal where he praised Nepal for setting a good example for nations currently going through a period of internal turmoil. His speech in Japan can be seen as a stern message to countries like China and Russia that are indulging in some form of expansionism.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3FokpNlWGsU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=1210&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></div>
<p>Since China has shown an expansionist mindset, the world is becoming increasingly anxious and this works well to Modi ‘s(and hence India’s) advantage. Suddenly, with Modi at the helm, the world has started seeing India as a viable alternative market to export things to. And Modi’s pragmatic, practical approach towards negotiating with nations, helps matters too. This was evident during his recent trip to Japan where, while he got Japan to pledge 35 billion dollars to India in various forms of investment and development works, he did not concede to the request by the Japanese, who are increasingly getting weary of China’s growing presence in their nearby territories, to upgrade the defense meetings to the cabinet level, mainly not to antagonize China. China, under Xi Jinping, of course sees Modi as a person it can do business with.</p>
<p>With Al Qaeda conveying its intentions about targeting India, Modi will be forced to take some strong measures to counter the emerging and imminent threat. This could mean India may become an active player in the war against terrorism. Later this month, when Modi visits the US (and there are reports that there is a mad rush of people wanting to see him at Madison Square when he will deliver a speech), the world leaders of all major democracies might expect him to, among other things, address the subject of terrorism and how the world needs to face this threat jointly. Since the US has failed in countering the threat of terrorism by bombing countries, and arming jehadis et al, the world now needs new ways to deal with the problem. And that solution may well come from none other than the leader of the land where the second largest Muslim population in the world lives peacefully in a state of democracy.</p>

			<p><a href="https://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/islamic_rage_boy.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1464 size-full aligncenter" src="http://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/islamic_rage_boy.jpg?w=700" alt="Islamic Rage Boy"   /></a>I joined active politics around July last year because I felt the country was in doldrums and I, as a responsible citizen, had a duty to do something about it. But now that Mission 272+ is over, perhaps it&#8217;s time for us as a nation to once again move on with our lives and do what we must to make the world a better place. Narendra Modi is now the Prime Minister of the country. The ministers are working as hard as they can so we don&#8217;t necessarily need to outrage too much on every issue, even though the world seems to be getting uglier and uglier and things in India are deteriorating too, as far as society is concerned.</p>
<p>While I cannot say for how long I will be able to keep off politics, I am becoming increasingly immune to every day outrage and abuse I come across on social media. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me anymore who the congress supporters or AAP supporters are trying to troll or what opinions they are expressing regarding the BJP or the RSS. I do watch Mr Kejriwal&#8217;s videos because I really love his theories, and find his disgust for the BJP thoroughly entertaining. But nothing more than that. I don&#8217;t feel anything. It doesn&#8217;t matter to me what he speaks in his videos. But there is no doubt they have tremendous entertainment value and can help pass time.</p>
<p>In recent times, the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict has once again become very hot and the world has probably been shocked by the way Israel has cleverly used the social media to expose Hamas. While it&#8217;s very heartbreaking to see innocent Palestinian children die, I believe Hamas is more to blame for these deaths since by using them as shields, they leave little options for the Israelis who end up, inadvertently, committing the sin of killing children. I believe the world should, perhaps, consider directing its collective outrage towards Hamas more than it does for Israel. From the Indian point of view, India has to adopt a balanced approach since speaking in favor of Israel alienates a section of the domestic population too which is something which we should do our best to avoid. At the same time, India should definitely not condemn Israel because throughout history Israel has been very good to India by not only providing her with sophisticated weapons but also by providing India&#8217;s residents with thousands of jobs in Israel based companies (Most of my close friends once worked in an Israel based IT company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdocs">Amdocs</a>). That said, it&#8217;s welcome if private citizens go and show some love to Israel since there will always be enough people to support the Palestinians. Irrespective of domestic politics, it makes sense for India, diplomatically speaking, to have friendly relations with Israel considering they have always supported India on the issue of Kashmir. The fact that Israel has refused to sell arms to Pakistan cannot be ignored either.</p>
<p>Apart from the Israel Palestine issue, the whole of India is also feeling rather depressed about the growing number of reported incidents of rape. More than anything else, it&#8217;s the people in the administration who seem to be routinely disappointing people by their lackadaisical and uncooperative attitude towards the victim. A tough law has failed to deter rapists in India. The need of the hour seems to be tough enforcement of the law. In this regard, I believe the government has taken a good decision to open rape crisis <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/report/rape-crisis-centres-will-be-set-up-by-yearend-maneka-gandhi/20140602.htm">centers in all districts</a> in India. At the same time, hopefully Narendra Modi&#8217;s determination to provide toilets in all homes will gradually improve women&#8217;s security in India. That said, we might be missing one key issue as far as preventing rapes is concerned and that is how to prevent men from committing rape. Is more education required? Will it help if men started fearing women? How can this goal be achieved? And can we direct our collective outrage to a more productive channel and really come up with solutions to solve the rape problem not only in India but in the world?</p>
<p>While I believe outrage is necessary to change the world, perhaps it&#8217;s time for some of us to take a step back and reflect on what we can do to channelize this everyday outrage in a more constructive manner.As of now, there is no dearth of rabble-rousers in our midst but maybe it&#8217;s time to support these demagogues by coming up with solutions to problems since they are already doing a fantastic job of highlighting them. This way, even their efforts will not go in vain since their protests and demonstrations will lead to new solutions to known problems. That said, the day you feel not enough people are outraging, is the day you go and take part in that &#8220;protest&#8221;.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/10155452_1420075324912426_1560472410_n.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1387" src="http://siddharthgoyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/10155452_1420075324912426_1560472410_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Mission 272+ volunteers" width="300" height="225" /></a>So I took a tour of Kolkata as a part of my assignment in Mission 272+. The gentleman who sat across from me inside the train saw me doing some Math questions and asked me if I was a stats student. I told him I wasn&#8217;t and then went on to explain why I was doing Math questions. In between the conversation he asked me if I was visiting Kolkata for a reason and it was then that I told him who I was and why I was touring Kolkata. The gentleman&#8217;s eyes lit up as soon as I mentioned Narendra Modi&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes. Modi is very essential. We all want development in Hooghly (That was the native place of the gentleman in question). The CPM has completely destroyed it over the past so many years. We are now fed up of it all. While Mamata&#8217;s regime has been fine, in the center almost everyone I know wants Modi to become the Prime Minister and is going to vote for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now this came as a pleasant surprise to me since I was not expecting a native of Hooghly to praise the BJP and Narendra Modi. And I would have dismissed it as one man&#8217;s opinion had that gentleman not initiated a conversation in Bengali with other people present in the coach and informed me that each and every one of the 6 passengers sitting across from us also supported Narendra Modi to become India&#8217;s Prime Minister. One among those 6 gentlemen had actually attended the NaMo rally which had occured at Brigade ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people of the Trinamool Congress also attended the rally. It has made a HUGE impact. Modi is an outsider but we really liked the fact that he reached out to us and addressed us. If you want our vote you should give us this much respect and Modi has done that. Things have changed significantly in entire Bengal after the Brigade.&#8221; said the gentleman who had attended the rally.</p>
<p>As the train halted at the Howrah station in Kolkata, I got a call from a gentleman in his early 40s. He was an RSS man who had himself offered to pick me up from the station. An offer which I had shameless accepted without even pretending to show reluctance. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue' title=':P'>:P</span> This gentleman owns a food business which employs more than a hundred people. And yet not a shred of arrogance or ego could be sensed in him. Thus it was embarrassing for me when he apologized to me for &#8220;inconveniencing me&#8221; for coming late. Quite frankly I don&#8217;t even bother picking up my own brother from the airport when he comes once a year from Europe. But next time I will.</p>
<p>As we traveled in his car, we started discussing local Kolkata and Bengal politics. It was surprising for me to find out how much polarization had taken place in Bengal and how much demographic changes had occurred. Of course violence in Bengal during elections was not unheard of. (Violence is a by product of socialism/communism. Communism basically kills your ambition and you accept your fate. When you you don&#8217;t expect anything much from life, you can get frustrated which can lead to violence. )</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to Kalighat where volunteers of Mission 272+ had gathered and were doing a campaign event. This was right opposite to the famous Kalighat temple. The area is also generally considered to be a Trinamool den since Mamata Didi lives there.  There was a big canopy of Mission 272+, a tea vendor who was selling tea. A desk outside the canopy where a man was speaking out loud something in Bengali. I could understand a few words since Bengali has its origins in Hindi only. And then the BJP candidate, Tathagat Roy came amidst chants of &#8220;Swagatam Swagatam&#8221;. And he held an interactive discussion with the people. In the meantime, 5-6 well educated, professionals wearing &#8220;NaMo&#8221; Tshirts started to handout pamphlets chanting &#8220;Vote for Modi, Vote for Modi&#8221; and &#8220;Aibar Modi Aibar Modi (Whatever that means)&#8221;. What was interesting to note was that people who took the leaflets did not take simply throw them away but took their time reading it.</p>
<p>Vivek Singh, one of the coordinators of Mission 272+, while distributing pamphlets, chanced upon a very old gentleman who-if I understood it right- said that his income will increase if Modi would come. You may also look at the below video to understand what I am talking about. I captured the whole event in my camera. Do notice the people reading the leaflets.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/z9bzz_4b3Dg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></div>
<p>This Mission 272+ team organizes multiple events on a daily basis in different parts of Kolkata and have interacted with several lacs of people already. The one thing where the BJP is lacking right now in Kolkata is the booth management on the final day. If the BJP is able to cover that base (and things are looking bright), nothing can stop it from emerging as a major force in 2014 in West Bengal.</p>

			<p>Vote for India is a slogan which has been given by Narendra Modi for the upcoming 2014 elections. I have always found this slogan to be intriguing and it took me some time to interpret it. I have now defined the meaning of Vote for India in 2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are choosing our Prime Minister. In these elections, we are voting  to choose our head of state and not the head of our particular constituency. Whenever something bad happens, we blame our Prime Minister and not our MP. Till about a few months ago, I didn&#8217;t even know who my MP was to be honest. Hence if we can get wise, we should ONLY consider who our Prime Minister will when we go out and vote for an election symbol. The candidate should not matter.</li>
<li>We are not voting to solve our day to day life problems such as water supply, or drainage but are voting to solve national problems such as corruption, unemployment, slow economic growth, and external threats. Hence instead of voting for our constituency or our state, we are &#8220;Voting for India&#8221;. Because if India&#8217;s fundamental problems are solved, then only will our lives get better.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the meaning of &#8220;Vote for India&#8221; can be communicated to the people effectively, there is no force on earth or heaven which can stop Narendra Modi from becoming the next Prime Minister of India.</p>

<p>With country gearing up for 2014 elections, Narendra Modi seems to have become the default choice for the Prime Minister’s post. The Congress has given up the race and so has the left front and even AAP voter has been rendered thoroughly disappointed after Arvind Kejriwal’s incompetence to administer (apart from his <em>nautanki</em>) was recently exposed.</p>
</div>
<p>While the BJP has to a very large extent succeeded in selling Narendra Modi, it’s now important for it to complement that effort by also making the Lotus Flower, the symbol of change. Ultimately, the Lotus Flower symbolizes the BJP and it is the BJP candidates in different Lok Sabha constituencies which will ensure that Narendra Modi ultimately becomes the Prime Minister of the country. So how can the BJP sell lotus flower? There are several ways to do that and not surprisingly, it is Narendra Modi himself who is leading the effort.</p>
<p>a) <b>Local Mission X Lotuses</b>: In his Odisha rally recently, Narendra Modi demanded 21 Lotuses from the people of Odisha so that he has a clear channel to work for the development of Odisha. The same strategy can be adopted by BJP groundworkers at the local level where each state can start its own Mission X Lotuses. For example, the state of UP can begin Mission 80 Lotuses.  Odisha can start 21 Lotuses and so on. This way the workers will have a goal in mind and will feel accountable towards that goal.</p>
<p>b) <b>Lotus Flower as a brand</b>: Kamal Sandesh is the name of a monthly BJP newsletter that is mailed to BJP members. Just like Kamal Sandesh, we can have several commodities like Kamal kameez, kamal topi, kamal cups, or even kamal chhap “jhadu”. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span></p>
<p>c) Campaign called<b> “Why vote for Lotus” </b>can be launched immediately asking people why they will vote for Lotus. Videos can be recorded and a prize can be given to the person who gives the best response. This will be something like the “Mere Sapno Ka Bharat” campaign.</p>
<p>d) Goddess Laxmi who is generally associated with wealth also depicted standing on a Lotus flower. Thus wealth can be equated with the Lotus.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">If Narendra Modi was the BJP&#8217;s election symbol, then no campaign would have been necessary. But since the election symbol is the lotus flower it&#8217;s time the BJP supporters realize the gap in their campaign. The sooner the Lotus flower symbol and BJP becomes synonymous with NaMo, the easier it will get to win the booths on the election day!</span></p>

			<p>When you read something like this from a prominent Indian artist</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>. Takshila is in Bihar which was invaded by Sikander. Chandragupt was from Gupta dynasty.Nehru should not have been the 1st PM. Perfect !!</p>
<p>&mdash; Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Javedakhtarjadu/statuses/395844008775151616">October 31, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>, &#8220;you&#8221; are bound to feel that Modi might have made a blooper during his Hunkaar rally speech. I am going to ignore what the Times of India said about the so-called bloopers but I think Mr Javed Akhtar definitely can do with some history lessons. I put the word &#8220;you&#8221; in quotes because if this is the level of a so called eminent Indian, I shudder to think what chapters do Indians remember from history. Take Chandragupta for example, this is what Modi said about him:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/j8ont7QjwS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=338&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></div>
<p>So here&#8217;s what he said &#8220;Agar Gupta vansh ko yaad karein, toh Chandragupt ki raajneeti humein prerna deti hai.&#8221;</p>
<p>What most Indians don&#8217;t know (or don&#8217;t remember) is that apart from the Maurya Dynasty, there was another dynasty known as the Gupta dynasty whose founder was also known as Chandragupta. Coincidentally, this dynasty was also based out of Patliputra (modern day Patna). As per wikipedia, Chandragupta I &#8220;is known for forging alliances with many powerful families in the Ganges region.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_I" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_I</a></p>
<p>While the Mauryan King Chandragupt Maurya, the grandfather of Asoka and the protege of Chanakya, was a great conqueror, he wasn&#8217;t exactly known for his &#8220;politics&#8221; whereas Chandragupta, the founder of the Gupta Empire built his empire with a combination of tactfulness and aggression. </p>
<p>Hence what Modi said made 100% sense to those of us who remember our history, but the incident shows how much ignorance prevails in India today so much so that even prominent people like Javed Akhtar get confused and sadly, start mocking people without verifying. </p>
<p>In my next post, I will tell you how stupid you are when you mock Modi because he mentioned Taxila. </p>

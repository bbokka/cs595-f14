				<p>I&#8217;ve been doing alot of thinking since i went back to school last month. And i&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that you can&#8217;t have a career and a family at the same time as a woman. You have to make a choice about what&#8217;s more important to you because something will suffer as you try to do both.</p>
<p>All the friends that i have that didn&#8217;t have kids at a young age are fairly career oriented and consumed in their jobs. They work hours upon hours, make excellent money, drive nice cars, have nice houses, but something&#8217;s missing. Most of them don&#8217;t have serious relationships because no one wants to come second to their girlfriend&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>Then i look at my friends and myself that have children, that had them before their careers started. We struggle. We sacrifice. But we love. I love my daughter to the moon and back. She makes me feel like going on when i would normally give up, lock myself in a closet and blow my brains on the walls. But i continually ask myself, am i doing the right thing? Do i suck as a mom? Am i being neglectful? Do i have the correct balance?</p>
<p>All of the decisions i make are based on whether or not there is longevity. I am one of the most indecisive people i know, yet when i finally do decide, it&#8217;s for real. I decided to go back to school because I can&#8217;t get comfortable in my position because there is no upward movement without further education. And i knew i didn&#8217;t want to do the same routine everyday for the next 40 years. </p>
<p>However, i feel like a terrible mother. I only see my daughter for a few hours in the morning before school, and a few hours after school before bed. I work every single solitary weekend so i don&#8217;t get to see her then. I keep telling myself that it&#8217;s only temporary, and the benefits outweigh the costs, but in the back of my mind i&#8217;m asking if this is really true. I feel like i&#8217;m missing out on so many of the little, yet important pieces of her elementary school life. I don&#8217;t want to be so consumed in myself and my education that i wake up and my daughter is a teenager that hates me because i was never there for her.</p>
<p>So, i kind of understand the reason that most women wait until they&#8217;re settled in their career before deciding to get married and having kids. However, then your faced with the dilemma of advanced maternal age, as well as the glass ceiling. No one wants a woman executive that has to take maternity leave, call off for a sick child, leave early to attend their child&#8217;s sporting event, or come in to work late because their child was bawling their eyes out when mom dropped them off at daycare. </p>
<p>We are forced to choose what aspect is more important to us. And pray that we don&#8217;t regret our decision when it&#8217;s all said and done. I pray that one day all of these dilemmas will be obsolete, that one day we as women will be able to successfully find the balance between career and family. Until then, i tell women to think hard, think deep, but follow your heart. One day it will all make sense. I hope.</p>

				<p>The right thing to do is so wrong. People sacrifice their lives, sense of self and happiness for the wrong people.</p>
<p>Men-women too, but mostly men. Staying with women you really don&#8217;t want to be with to keep the &#8216;family&#8217; together. You don&#8217;t want society to call you a deadbeat, or have the world think you walked out on your kid(s). You don&#8217;t want the mom to try to use the child(ren) as a weapon against you because that just gets ugly.</p>
<p>Women-men too, but mostly women. Sticking with a man you know ain&#8217;t shit. Trying to change someone you know damn well doesn&#8217;t want to change because that&#8217;s who you want to be with. But who are you? Supreme? Almighty? NO! You are a person put in situations in life to be tested. You determine whether you pass or fail. Just because you think you&#8217;re doing the right thing doesn&#8217;t mean you automatically pass. Sometimes you have to walk away because it can make you stronger. Whereas if you stay you could be perceived as weak because you aren&#8217;t willing to take the steps. Now these subjects can be argued until we are all blue in the face. It&#8217;s a catch 22. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t. Weak if you walk away, strong if you stay?</p>
<p>The reality of it all is this: people only do what you let them. While you think you are the strong person sticking it out, the other person thinks you are weak because they know you won&#8217;t go anywhere no matter what they do to you. Did you ever think of it that way? Yeah, me either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on both sides. I wanted the whole family thing to work out, but it wasn&#8217;t right for me and I couldn&#8217;t fake it. Sometimes you just have to realize that you aren&#8217;t meant to be and the reason you were brought together was to create the beautiful being that you have. Now I know, back in the day, this that &amp; the third&#8230;but let&#8217;s be serious. More children today have parents that aren&#8217;t together than those that are. Not justifying broken homes, just stating they are prevalent &amp; no longer taboo. It&#8217;s not gonna kill anyone.</p>
<p>I also had a &#8216;ain&#8217;t shit nigga.&#8217; He put his thing in anything and lied about it. But i stayed true, aside from a few indiscretions of my own, which I, unlike him, told the truth about. I thought that if i continued to be to him what i wanted him to be to me, that one day he would wake up and see he didn&#8217;t need anyone but me. Didn&#8217;t work. Oddly enough, I&#8217;m just fine. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how you have someone you think you can&#8217;t live without no longer in your life and you see how much better things are and can be. Then you sit back and think, well shit I shoulda been done this! Lol. Just remember: everything that&#8217;s good to ya ain&#8217;t good for ya. Do what makes you truly happy because in the end, all the people in your business eventually have to worry about themselves and their own damn problems one day.</p>
<p>Peace &amp; Love</p>

				<p>So normally I hate talk radio.  I listen to the radio to hear the music.  I don&#8217;t give a shit about the gossip of who did what to whom and why.  However, as I was flipping through my channels on XM something caught my ear.  This guy was on there talking about how he was in a relationship but was cheating on his girlfriend with multiple chicks.  First and foremost&#8230;I hope that his girlfriend wasn&#8217;t listening and heard this, because if I was her I would have pulled a Lefteye (RIP) on his ass.  Bleach and flames, bleach and flames.  I digress&#8230;</p>
<p>He proceeds to tell the radio host that he cheats on his girl because she won&#8217;t give it to him and all this and that.  He cheats on a regular basis, yada yada.  So the host asks him if that&#8217;s the case then why doesn&#8217;t he just man up and tell her he&#8217;s not happy and leave her.  This nigga had the nerve to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think she could handle it.&#8221;  Child please!  The host told him that he was selfish and he was probably the one who wouldn&#8217;t be able to handle it.  See I&#8217;m not even going to make this a male bashing post, because females do it to.  So what I&#8217;m going to say is going to apply to everyone.</p>
<p>YOU MOTHERFUCKERS ARE SELFISH.  Bottom line.  All you people out here cheating on your significant others because you don&#8217;t want them but don&#8217;t want anyone else to have them are ruining it for genuine and loyal people like myself.  When I am in a relationship I am devoted to that person and that person only.  As long as that man is playing his part in all aspects, then there is no need for me to go elsewhere.  If I feel I need to go elsewhere, then I need to re-evaluate my relationship.  The re-evaluation comes with communication of the things that I feel are lacking in my relationship to my man, and if he decides to change and step it up then good, if not then see ya.  It&#8217;s not really that cut and dry and easy, but it is what it is and it works.</p>
<p>People that just want to test the waters and dip and dab in this and that need NOT be in a relationship.  I swear I see so many people in relationships doing more single things than the single people that I know are just dealing with one person.  It&#8217;s really sickening and it&#8217;s unfair.  However, I have to blame the significant others at one point because PEOPLE ONLY DO WHAT YOU LET THEM.  So if you let them cheat and take them back without making them deal with what they did, then of course they are going to do it over and over and over and over again.  So in all actuality it isn&#8217;t just that one person&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>In a relationship, that person should be the first and last person you think of when waking and going to sleep, your best friend, your confidant, your lover, your everything and your one and only.  If you feel that they cannot fill one of these aspects and you venture outside of your union then you are no longer considered to be in a relationship in my eyes.  You cannot be in a relationship with more than one person, unless you are a polygamist and the outside parties all know about each other and are okay with it like in other countries.  But let&#8217;s be serious.  NO ONE IS OKAY WITH THAT!  Do you realize how much shit goes down from people cheating.  You got people checking cell phones and calling numbers, stalking and showing up at places unannounced, fighting, stabbing, shooting, all kinda shit because people want to share the shit thats in their pants with everyone.  And continuously failing at trying to be sneaky about it at that.</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to thing that people can&#8217;t handle the truth.  However, lies are way more detrimental.  Just think about if you were a man, and you were with a girl, and she cheated on you but never told you,.  You guys have a kid that you think is yours, he gets sick and needs a blood transfusion, you go to donate and find out that you nor your girl have the same blood type as the child. NOT TELLING IS JUST AS BAD AS BLATANT LYING.</p>
<p>From my experience and friendships with males, guys hurt way worse when they find out that their girl is being piped down by the next nigga.  So while your slipping and sliding with the next, why don&#8217;t you thing about how you would feel if your significant other was sharing the things that you are sharing with the person you&#8217;re laying beside for the temporary.  Think about your girl lettin some other dude put his mouth on &#8220;your&#8221; pussy.  Or better yet your girl putting her mouth on his dick.  Then think about the fact that when she gets home, she might let you put your mouth back on that pussy that he had his mouth and dick in earlier that day.  Disgusting right?  And ladies, you think its okay for him to come home and let you put your mouth on his dick that he just had in the next girl&#8217;s pussy right?  You people wonder why STDs are so rampant these days.  Regardless of whether you&#8217;re strapping up or not, I never seen anyone put a condom or a diaphragm on their mouth.</p>
<p>Shit is real out here, and in all honesty sometimes cheating doesn&#8217;t fall mainly on the sexual aspect of the relationship.  Sometimes there is a gap in communication between two people and they venture to an outside source to vent, to talk to, to befriend.  They get  closer, then one day they end up having sex, and it stems from there into a crazy fucked up situation.  However, what does the problem come from? COMMUNICATION.  Like I said earlier, your mate should be your confidant.  If you have a problem with them that you feel that you cannot discuss with them, that you have to talk to with someone else, there enlies your dilemma.  If you cannot attack your problem at the source, there will be more problems to come.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always tried to be as up front and honest about things as possible, and even when I tried to hide things they eventually ended up surfacing because I have a hell of a guilty conscience.  I used to get my ass WHOOPED as a child for lying about the smallest things, so honesty is a big thing with me.  Sometimes people feel as though they will be and are punished for lying, but in all actualilty, who can be mad at you for &#8220;keeping it 100?&#8221;  It might sting for a second, but once the person sits and thinks about it they have no choice but to respect you for respecting them enough to tell them the truth.  And if they are a real person they should have no problem with you telling them how it is.  If they seem to have a problem with you telling the truth, then they have some issues of their own that they need to iron out then get back to you.</p>
<p>Sorry if things were a little graphic this time around but hey, we&#8217;re all adults here.  People need to do some serious deep thinking about this relationship shit, and communicate better with their mates to they are in the know.  Nobody likes to find out shit about someone they&#8217;re dealing with by accident.  Yeezy said it best, &#8220;&#8230;and deception is the worst felony, so never fuck nobody without tellin me&#8230;&#8221;  I&#8217;m out.</p>

				<p>&#8230;is so real. Like it&#8217;ll have you on a whole different level of life. But the timing has to be right or it won&#8217;t work. </p>
<p>Before, i&#8217;d be the type to just walk when things don&#8217;t go my way. I hear some shit i don&#8217;t like, or feel like i&#8217;m in danger of being hurt. However, walking away due to fear can cause you to miss something.</p>
<p>So instead of taking a walk, we talk. Straighten each other out, put all the cards on the table. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. What&#8217;s understood doesn&#8217;t need explained. We been here this long right? We had time to see what life was like without one another and decided that it was just so unbearable. Lol</p>
<p>So instead of worrying about what DID happen or what COULD happen or what WILL happen, let&#8217;s focus on what IS HAPPENING. We are building. We are accomplishing our goals. We are each other&#8217;s voice of reason, coach, spine, etc. If we won&#8217;t let one another give up on what we want in life, why would we give up on each other?</p>
<p>Things don&#8217;t always go as planned. One thing i do know is that i won&#8217;t allow myself to be the cause for things falling apart. If i don&#8217;t see it with my eyes or hear it with my ears i&#8217;m not worried. I&#8217;m going to continue to do the right thing regardless because i know i am appreciated for such.</p>

				<p>Everyone says the want someone that is independant and successful, but they resent all the time and work it takes to get there&#8230;u know the saying, &#8216;a man with time has no money, and a man with money has no time&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always considered myself 2nd or 3rd in line to my counterpart&#8217;s life. First and foremost will be his career. If he has nothing to work for or towards, why should i want him? If he has to put in long late hour to reach his dream, why should i complain? It won&#8217;t always be that way! You have to think towards the future, instead of the now. No complaining or nagging that he doesn&#8217;t have time for you! Instead, make it easier for him. Appreciate the time you do get. Whether a 5 minute random phone call, or a short 30 minute lunch date. Cherish those seconds you were there at his side watching him put that work in. It will make those moments more valuable once he makes it to his destiny. Ride out for that man as he&#8217;s climbing that ladder. Be by his side. He may need you to whisper words of encouragement in his ear when he feels like giving up. I promise he won&#8217;t forget it.</p>
<p>If he has kid(s) they damn sure better be second! If you put me before your kids we won&#8217;t make it to the front door. Nothing besides the money to take care of that baby should come between them. Bottom line. No ifs, ands, or maybes.</p>
<p>I came up with this hierarchy because that&#8217;s how i live my life. I can&#8217;t take care of my baby with no money in my pocket. Best believe i&#8217;m gonna ride the money train til the wheels fall off. I&#8217;m always striving for better, looking to advance, and thinking towards the future. After all those long days of work, seeing the smile on my baby&#8217;s face and hearing &#8216;i missed you so much mommy&#8217;, nothing matters in the world, and i know i&#8217;m doing the right thing. And once i find the man who understands where he fits in and plays his role accordingly, the puzzle will be complete.</p>
<p>So be careful what you wish for. Don&#8217;t say you want someone or some thing that you&#8217;re not willing to stick around for when the going gets rough. Nothing worth having is easy, and nothing easy is worth having. Remember that.</p>

				<p>Women are crazy. We want what we want when we want it. And when we don&#8217;t get it we complain, pout and bitch. But while we&#8217;re doing these things, being unappreciative, and worrying about what we don&#8217;t have&#8230;ANOTHER BITCH is appreciating what we do have.</p>
<p>So what if he doesn&#8217;t do it the way you expect him to. It&#8217;s easy to tell if a man is being genuine in his efforts. And if he is doing everything in his power to keep that smile on your face, HOW DARE YOU expect more from him? No two people think alike. Not even twins. And men are the furthest thing from mind readers. But they&#8217;re not stupid.</p>
<p>How long have we known that it takes men longer to mature than women? So what makes you think that because you&#8217;re ready to take it to the next level that he is??? First of all, communication is KEY. Closed mouths don&#8217;t get fed, however if you keep your mouth open too long you&#8217;re gonna catch a fly. So chill. Let him know what&#8217;s up, but don&#8217;t demand a thing. And if you feel like you need to move on then go. But don&#8217;t get mad when you see the next bitch on your boo because you got impatient and bounced. Been there, done that.</p>
<p>Realize this, you can&#8217;t make a man make a move when he&#8217;s not ready. Recipe for disaster. That&#8217;s like merging on a crowded expressway. You make that man feel like he has no choice or you&#8217;re giving ultimatums he&#8217;ll resist. Give him some space, let him know what it&#8217;s like to miss you. And he&#8217;ll either A-realize he can&#8217;t live without you, or B-say fuck it and be without you. But the choice is HIS! Why would you want to be with someone you MADE feel like they had no choice but to be with you? </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t play too hard to get though because that&#8217;ll just turn him off and move him right along. Just put up enough resistance so that he knows you&#8217;re not to be fucked with. But also don&#8217;t be so caught up in what everyone else has going on. You don&#8217;t know if your friends are TRULY happy in their relationships. Don&#8217;t try to force some shit just to be part of the crowd. Dare to be different. If people worried about themselves as much as they worried about everyone else, we&#8217;d all be better off.</p>
<p>Stop spending so much time thinking about what you don&#8217;t have, appreciate what you do&#8230;and if you feel its not enough then weigh the costs an benefits, then decide. Don&#8217;t be stupid, know your worth. But most importantly remember this: just because he doesn&#8217;t love you the way YOU expect him to doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s not loving you the best way he knows how.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t need a title to be faithful. I need boundaries. I was loyal to a man that wasn&#8217;t mine. Well, not only mine. But i was loyal because i was happy. All i need to know is your expectations of me and i will fulfill. However, the not knowing is what gets me into trouble. I&#8217;m not your girl, you&#8217;re not my man&#8230;u do u, i do me, sometimes we do each other&#8230;then u do her, i&#8217;m doin him&#8230;fuck no. </p>
<p>I just want to know. What are we doing? What do you want from me? I don&#8217;t need to be anyone&#8217;s girlfriend. The thought of a title terrifies me. However i&#8217;d like to know that you&#8217;d rather i not go to dinner with other guys, or text someone else all day &amp; night. You want me to be real with you and i will. I&#8217;ll tell u straight up that i wouldn&#8217;t like it if you did something and tell you why.</p>
<p>The thing is double standards run rampant and have since the beginning of time. I&#8217;m supposed to not be your girl but i&#8217;m not supposed to entertain other men while you&#8217;re poking your penis in every dark hole you see? Humph. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, i don&#8217;t wanna slide on every hard dick in a 20 mile radius, but i damn sure ain&#8217;t bouta put all my eggs in one basket. The only way that&#8217;ll happen is if I KNOW ITS FOR REAL. Like w/o a shadow of a doubt, u for me n me for u. But people are so caught up in their pasts it rarely gets to that point. </p>
<p>We as men &amp; women are so caught up in who hurt us that we won&#8217;t give the next person the chance to do us RIGHT! I am the queen of relationship sabotage. That&#8217;s why i tend to not ask questions because i end up pissed at the answer. Or i get lied to. So fuck it, if it&#8217;s meant for me to know i&#8217;ll find out eventually.</p>
<p>Unfortunately love &amp; feelings aren&#8217;t as black and white as we wish for them to be, and emotions tend to turn shit into madness.  However, if we would be straight up in the beginning, lay all our cards out, express our expectations, and go from there it may be alot better. But really, what are the chances of that happening? So we sit &amp; wait and expect each other to read our minds &amp; think how we think. And end up slashing tires, busting windows, and talkin shit about each other via social network.</p>

[14]The vampire

   I blinked rapidly twice, I was very weak, I had not fed in a week, and
   I could feel The Thirst closing in upon me.
   Evening approached as I sauntered down the streets of Venice, I watched
   the people closely looking for someone to feed on-I am a man of class,
   and I am very selective when it comes to my choice of victims, and
   right then, it was a very hard thing to do, because, I hated having to
   thirst before I feed. As I walked on, my vision blurred for a moment, I
   cleared it with a shake of my beautiful head, I took a couple of steps
   forward and then it hit me with full force-The Thirst, I lurched
   forward for a semi-second, my pupils began to dilate rapidly, and
   before anybody could notice any change in my appearance, I slithered to
   a dark corner in an alley, I was safe for the moment.
   Now, I shall describe “The Thirst” for you so that you will understand
   why it cannot be ignored. Blood to me is like air, I need it to
   survive, imagine yourself as a mortal running out of air, that is how I
   feel when the thirst hits, but as thirsty as I felt, I still waited for
   the right victim.
   Minutes passed, I did not lose patience, for this is an essential
   character which I possess in abundance, it’s what makes me a very good
   hunter, my wait was not in vain, a beautiful lady passed by the alley,
   I wondered why she was alone, but I did not wonder for long, I had a
   pressing need. I followed her, and as she walked, I took the whole of
   her into my mind; she was of average height, blonde, she also looked
   classy, it was all in the walk, I looked around, it was now or later, I
   floated to her rear, and dug my fangs into her slender neck- I am not
   the type to play with my prey. In seconds, I was done. I felt so good
   then and almost satisfied, the same way you would feel if you recieved
   something you have been longing for.
   My hands in my pocket, I strolled up the street, heading home. I looked
   up, and I saw a man looking at me intently, he had noticed something
   about me
   “Your eyes” he said.
   “What’s wrong with them?”, I replied.
   “They’re red-rimmed”, he said.
   I cursed under my breath, definitely he knows what I am, but I decided
   to let him go, and I walked past him. However, I was wrong for being
   nice to him, in half a second, he had pulled out a silver dagger, which
   was headed to my chest as I could tell, I was faster than that, I
   looped off the dagger from his grip, and heard it hit the pavement.
   Still, I walked on, not in the mood to kill him, but as fate would
   prove him ready, he insisted on making sure he would be the one to rid
   me of this world. He stepped forward with a crucifix, aimed at my
   chest, I glided smoothly to his back, and with a very light shove,
   pushed his spinal cord out of his body, I watched him fall to the
   ground lifeless in seconds, I sighed, “you didn’t have to die, all you
   had to do was walk away”, I thought.
   I looked around, and there was a little boy not far away from where I
   had commited this gruesome act, I ignored him, and sauntered up the
   street, feeling satisfied, and dis-satisfied

[26]Doubt

   It had been a long journey, I reckoned as I approached the temple from
   the west entrance. I snorted out dust from my nostrils, ran my hands
   through my hair and shook my hair to get rid of the dust in it. I
   looked down at my boots, they were encrusted in dust, I stomped my feet
   against the ground one after the other to get rid of the dust and shook
   my coat as I entered the temple.
   As usual, the temple was empty, a little bell was jingling as the wind
   from the eastern window blew it leisurely. I stretched my entire body
   and flexed my neck muscles as I approached the altar. I knelt down and
   placed my 5-feet sword, Isis on the floor beside me. As I was about to
   start saying my prayers, I heard a rustle behind the curtains at my
   left side. I rolled my eyeballs slightly to the left, as this was a
   mean to look around without turning my head. The rustling ceased, then
   I saw a figure clad in purple flit across the temple to my right side.
   My mind was no longer on the prayers I was about to say, they were now
   more fixated on whatever creature was darting around the temple. I
   heard a swish at my back and just in time, I blocked a sword with Isis.
   In seconds, I analysed my current situation; I still had one of my
   knees on the floor, my body twisted a few degrees backwards, my arms
   extended with Isis holding another sword bearing a striking resemblance
   to it at bay. I looked up from the sword at its wielder, he was a man
   of average build, like me, with skin as white as snow. He had
   jet-black, shoulder-length hair, with a part of his hair covering his
   left eye. He had a crooked smile on his face and he had yellow eyes,
   with green specks in the pupils, just like mine.
   I pushed at him with my sword, forcing him to move back. I got my other
   knee off the ground and stood to face him. He jumped, I jumped too, we
   met in midair, our swords clashing in the air, sending sparks of light
   into the air. I muttered a quick prayer as I engaged him in a
   swordfight that lasted half an hour.
   Now and then, we slashed at each other, never scoring, for we were
   equally matched. I could feel my arms growing tired for wielding Isis
   for so long, and considering the fact that I had just arrived from a
   long journey. I lashed out my right foot at my opponent, he blocked,
   and I flipped back off his arm, buying myself space and time. I cast
   Isis aside and whipped out my guns from my side holster, squeezing
   repeatedly at the triggers, firing rounds after rounds at him. He was
   very quick, blocking every single bullet with his sword. Suddenly, he
   was in front of me, and in one fluid movement, he slashed his sword at
   my face. With my eyes wide open from the surprise at the speed at which
   he appeared in front of me, I evaded the sword, but I was too slow, for
   his sword cut my left cheekbone. I gasped as I felt blood erupt from
   the cut. I withdrew to a corner and put my left hand up to my face, I
   wiped the blood and looked. My left hand was smeared with my blood, my
   own blood. A new rage crept into me as the sight of the blue liquid
   infuriated me greatly.
   Looking at my adversary, I pulled off my coat and cast aside my shirt,
   then I picked up Isis again and charged at him, filled with new
   strength from the rage that coursed through me. I was moving too quick
   for him now and I succeeded in landing a few blows on his body. He
   staggered backwards, weakened as he dropped to the ground. I flung Isis
   aside and picked him up with my left hand, pummeling his face with my
   right. I punched him til the rage in me had coursed out. I threw him at
   the north end of the temple, and as he sailed across the temple, I
   hurled his sword at his midsection. It impaled him to the wall.
   With a deep sigh, I turned my back to him and was about to walk to
   where I dropped my coat when I heard a creak. I turned now to see him
   pulling the sword out of his body. When he had pulled it out of his
   body, he dropped to the ground and stood again. I could see his face,
   clean as ever and wondered how many punches I had administered to it.
   Was it not enough? I could see the spot where the sword had impaled him
   closing up rapidly. I frowned and uttered my first words to him “what
   are you?”. In response, he said “I am just like you…” He tossed a
   little grenade in the air, the blast created an opening in the roof,
   and he leapt in the air, pulling himself up through the opening. I said
   to him in anger and frustration “But…there is none like me” “Talk to
   father” he said in response. I fired shots at him as he disappeared.
   As I walked to pick up my coat, I couldn’t help the feeling that I had
   been lied to, for so long, I had thought I was my father’s only son.

[31]deception

   I’ve been sitting here for the
   past five hours at the workshop trying
   to get my phone repaired. I’m pretty
   much frustrated at the moment and it’s
   all over my face, if not all over my body.
   This is the price I have to pay for being
   a developer. This is it.
   Last night, I was copying some
   game files from a friend’s droid to my
   phone and I was a little excited because
   I thought I was going to get some real
   action as soon as I was through with the
   exams, so I copied about 10Gig worth of
   game files, these games were dope, 3D
   games, I’m talking about games like
   “Amazing Spiderman”, “FIFA 14”, and
   everything was going quite smoothly, I
   couldn’t even feel the hungry worms
   eating away at my stomach, I was
   engrossed in the copying of these files.
   (Come to think of it, this long wait is
   making me feel the hunger real bad and
   I can’t leave my phone with this repair
   guy, I don’t trust him that much).
   So, I finished late in the night
   and I proceeded to copy the game files
   to my droid. I was excited. I installed the
   first one- AVB Revolution or some shit
   like that. It played, and this motivated
   me to install the other games too. I
   copied the game files for FIFA14 and
   installed it, that one played too.
   Awesome!, so I proceeded with
   “Amazing Spiderman” and was quite
   successful with that one too, then I
   installed it and opened the app. Well, it
   did play, opened the menu and I felt the
   graphics and I was like “Wow, this is
   some dope shit”, then after the whole
   loading process, only to start the game
   and the app booted off to the home
   screen. “What?” you could basically see
   this written on my face as I realized that
   the game’s graphics was way too heavy
   for my phone to play it. ( This is a game
   that has HD and 3D qualities.) Then I
   remembered seeing an app on my
   friend’s droid that allowed the game run
   smoothly- “ChainFire 3D”, so I promptly
   went to the Play Store and downloaded
   me some ChainFire, thinking all the while
   that I was up for some dope gaming as
   soon as I tweaked my droid with this
   app. I downloaded Chainfire and
   installed it, ran it and saw a warning that
   I didn’t pay attention to, a warning that
   would cost me #3000 today and I totally
   ignored it, on some I’m-a-droid-guy-I-
   can-handle-this-shit level. Then my
   phone rebooted and it couldn’t boot
   past the manufacturer logo, I thought
   my phone was messing with me,
   removed the battery and rebooted
   again, the same thing happened. I had
   encountered a boot loop error. I hard
   reset the droid to no avail, did
   everything I could do to the droid, as a
   developer, even tried downloading a
   custom ROM to flash it with, but my
   school’s WiFi proper messed up, a snail
   would win a race against it. Then I
   realized that the only option available
   was to give it up to the professionals,
   and yeah, that’s why I’m here right now.
   Well, the professional just walked up to
   me now to tell me that I can’t collect my
   droid today, tomorrow it is, I can’t even
   cry. I’m a man, but my phone is like the
   only companion I have. This is sad,
   right? *sighs* I gotta shut down this
   netbook now, trying to conserve the
   power on it, I’m in Nigeria

[10]Why Social Media Ideological Wars Matter

   [11]October 2, 2014 [12]Uncategorized

   A close friend of mine is, these days, trying hard to understand why
   there is so much noise on the social media and wonders if it achieves
   any purpose for the development of the country. He particularly
   referred to the latest incident involving a famous Indian journalist
   who is currently having a rather tough time in the US. My friend
   believes both sides are at fault but he really cannot appreciate what
   the NaMo supporters achieve by fighting that journalist and tweeting
   against him and shouldn’t they rather just do some constructive
   criticism of the government.

   Many people might ask the same question. Is there much to achieve from
   outraging against the journalists? And does it really help the
   development of the nation. The short answer is: Yes. There is
   tremendous merit in battling anyone you feel is trying to set some
   narrative which may be contrary to yours. Ultimately, it’s a war
   between ideologies. One ideology is that of hypocrisy and tighter
   government controls, and the other is that of good governance and free
   economy. Both sides come loaded with multitude of other phenomena. And
   the country works according to which ideology becomes dominant.

   Currently, it is the center right ideology which is dominant and the
   social media played a big role in making it dominant since social media
   influences the influencers and forces people to think empathize with a
   point of view.

   This is how it works:
    1. An incident occurs which has the potential to turn into an
       ideological battle.
    2. Side A makes one kind of noise
    3. Side B makes another kind of noise.
    4. In the end, whichever side wins, influences public opinion in its
       favor. This occurs through influencers present on the social media
       who keenly observe the patterns that emerge within the noise.
    5. This eventually translates into electoral dividend when elections
       come.

   The sum total of ideological wars that occur on the social media
   directly make an impact on a large population. The recent journalist
   incident was one small battle in this much larger war.

   In conclusion, if left liberals start winning these ideological battles
   more often, they would eventually win the war and we can be sure that
   UPA 3 will be back in India. J

[14]The World is Beginning to Look Up to Narendra Modi

   [15]September 19, 2014September 20, 2014 [16]Politics

   [17]narendra_modi--621x414--621x414 The world seems to be going deep
   into chaos with internal conflicts happening in the Arab world,
   Pakistan and Ukraine. After 9/11 it was widely expected that the US
   would go after the Jehadist forces. It did so but was criticized for
   its misadventure in Iraq. In hindsight, it did prove to be a monumental
   blunder considering Saddam Hussein’s regime was probably heaven
   compared to the situation that has emerged in Iraq now. The US did not
   finish the job in Iraq when it left it in 2011. Similarly, it appears
   that the US is going to leave Afghanistan to its fate as well. And
   what’s even more interesting is that the Americans don’t seem too
   bothered with these stands. This suggests that a time has come when the
   Americans seem to getting weary of all the conflicts they have got
   themselves involved in. And when the US seems more interested in
   empowering the Iraqis to deal with the ISIS situation themselves but is
   reluctant to send her own soldiers, the message gets even more clear:
   “We are done.” .(Check out the video below)

   Today, Obama is seen as a world leader, a title the American head of
   the state automatically assumes as soon as he is elected, who is weak
   and indecisive. And this has created a vacuum in world leadership where
   there does not seem to be anyone in particular the world can look up to
   solve the common problems of humanity.

   While it will be highly immature to dismiss the US’s superpower status,
   three very solid and ambitious world leaders have emerged who seem
   extremely interested in occupying the aforementioned leadership vacuum,
   the world is witnessing right now. While on the one hand there is
   Vladimir Putin from Russia who has of late shown expansionist
   tendencies, on the other, there is Xi Jinping of China who is the
   leader of the emerging super power, a super power which is largely
   loathed by the world. Things seem to have changed though, for the world
   at large, ever since Narendra Modi got elected as the Prime Minister of
   India.

   Modi seems to be fast emerging as a leader who is immensely likeable,
   has strong convictions, is extremely business friendly and is someone
   who seems to show a lot of concern for the world. This was very much
   evident from his speech in Nepal where he praised Nepal for setting a
   good example for nations currently going through a period of internal
   turmoil. His speech in Japan can be seen as a stern message to
   countries like China and Russia that are indulging in some form of
   expansionism.

   earch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&start=1210&wmode=transparent

   Since China has shown an expansionist mindset, the world is becoming
   increasingly anxious and this works well to Modi ‘s(and hence India’s)
   advantage. Suddenly, with Modi at the helm, the world has started
   seeing India as a viable alternative market to export things to. And
   Modi’s pragmatic, practical approach towards negotiating with nations,
   helps matters too. This was evident during his recent trip to Japan
   where, while he got Japan to pledge 35 billion dollars to India in
   various forms of investment and development works, he did not concede
   to the request by the Japanese, who are increasingly getting weary of
   China’s growing presence in their nearby territories, to upgrade the
   defense meetings to the cabinet level, mainly not to antagonize China.
   China, under Xi Jinping, of course sees Modi as a person it can do
   business with.

   With Al Qaeda conveying its intentions about targeting India, Modi will
   be forced to take some strong measures to counter the emerging and
   imminent threat. This could mean India may become an active player in
   the war against terrorism. Later this month, when Modi visits the US
   (and there are reports that there is a mad rush of people wanting to
   see him at Madison Square when he will deliver a speech), the world
   leaders of all major democracies might expect him to, among other
   things, address the subject of terrorism and how the world needs to
   face this threat jointly. Since the US has failed in countering the
   threat of terrorism by bombing countries, and arming jehadis et al, the
   world now needs new ways to deal with the problem. And that solution
   may well come from none other than the leader of the land where the
   second largest Muslim population in the world lives peacefully in a
   state of democracy.

[22]Channelizing our collective outrage to make the world a better place

   [23]July 20, 2014September 22, 2014 [24]Philosophy, [25]Politics,
   [26]Social

   [27]Islamic Rage Boy I joined active politics around July last year
   because I felt the country was in doldrums and I, as a responsible
   citizen, had a duty to do something about it. But now that Mission 272+
   is over, perhaps it’s time for us as a nation to once again move on
   with our lives and do what we must to make the world a better place.
   Narendra Modi is now the Prime Minister of the country. The ministers
   are working as hard as they can so we don’t necessarily need to outrage
   too much on every issue, even though the world seems to be getting
   uglier and uglier and things in India are deteriorating too, as far as
   society is concerned.

   While I cannot say for how long I will be able to keep off politics, I
   am becoming increasingly immune to every day outrage and abuse I come
   across on social media. It doesn’t matter to me anymore who the
   congress supporters or AAP supporters are trying to troll or what
   opinions they are expressing regarding the BJP or the RSS. I do watch
   Mr Kejriwal’s videos because I really love his theories, and find his
   disgust for the BJP thoroughly entertaining. But nothing more than
   that. I don’t feel anything. It doesn’t matter to me what he speaks in
   his videos. But there is no doubt they have tremendous entertainment
   value and can help pass time.

   In recent times, the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict has once again
   become very hot and the world has probably been shocked by the way
   Israel has cleverly used the social media to expose Hamas. While it’s
   very heartbreaking to see innocent Palestinian children die, I believe
   Hamas is more to blame for these deaths since by using them as shields,
   they leave little options for the Israelis who end up, inadvertently,
   committing the sin of killing children. I believe the world should,
   perhaps, consider directing its collective outrage towards Hamas more
   than it does for Israel. From the Indian point of view, India has to
   adopt a balanced approach since speaking in favor of Israel alienates a
   section of the domestic population too which is something which we
   should do our best to avoid. At the same time, India should definitely
   not condemn Israel because throughout history Israel has been very good
   to India by not only providing her with sophisticated weapons but also
   by providing India’s residents with thousands of jobs in Israel based
   companies (Most of my close friends once worked in an Israel based IT
   company called [28]Amdocs). That said, it’s welcome if private citizens
   go and show some love to Israel since there will always be enough
   people to support the Palestinians. Irrespective of domestic politics,
   it makes sense for India, diplomatically speaking, to have friendly
   relations with Israel considering they have always supported India on
   the issue of Kashmir. The fact that Israel has refused to sell arms to
   Pakistan cannot be ignored either.

   Apart from the Israel Palestine issue, the whole of India is also
   feeling rather depressed about the growing number of reported incidents
   of rape. More than anything else, it’s the people in the administration
   who seem to be routinely disappointing people by their lackadaisical
   and uncooperative attitude towards the victim. A tough law has failed
   to deter rapists in India. The need of the hour seems to be tough
   enforcement of the law. In this regard, I believe the government has
   taken a good decision to open rape crisis [29]centers in all districts
   in India. At the same time, hopefully Narendra Modi’s determination to
   provide toilets in all homes will gradually improve women’s security in
   India. That said, we might be missing one key issue as far as
   preventing rapes is concerned and that is how to prevent men from
   committing rape. Is more education required? Will it help if men
   started fearing women? How can this goal be achieved? And can we direct
   our collective outrage to a more productive channel and really come up
   with solutions to solve the rape problem not only in India but in the
   world?

   While I believe outrage is necessary to change the world, perhaps it’s
   time for some of us to take a step back and reflect on what we can do
   to channelize this everyday outrage in a more constructive manner.As of
   now, there is no dearth of rabble-rousers in our midst but maybe it’s
   time to support these demagogues by coming up with solutions to
   problems since they are already doing a fantastic job of highlighting
   them. This way, even their efforts will not go in vain since their
   protests and demonstrations will lead to new solutions to known
   problems. That said, the day you feel not enough people are outraging,
   is the day you go and take part in that “protest”.

[31]Palpable Modi Wave in West Bengal

   [32]March 30, 2014September 19, 2014 [33]Politics, [34]Uncategorized

   [35]Mission 272+ volunteers So I took a tour of Kolkata as a part of my
   assignment in Mission 272+. The gentleman who sat across from me inside
   the train saw me doing some Math questions and asked me if I was a
   stats student. I told him I wasn’t and then went on to explain why I
   was doing Math questions. In between the conversation he asked me if I
   was visiting Kolkata for a reason and it was then that I told him who I
   was and why I was touring Kolkata. The gentleman’s eyes lit up as soon
   as I mentioned Narendra Modi’s name.

   “Oh yes. Modi is very essential. We all want development in Hooghly
   (That was the native place of the gentleman in question). The CPM has
   completely destroyed it over the past so many years. We are now fed up
   of it all. While Mamata’s regime has been fine, in the center almost
   everyone I know wants Modi to become the Prime Minister and is going to
   vote for them.”

   Now this came as a pleasant surprise to me since I was not expecting a
   native of Hooghly to praise the BJP and Narendra Modi. And I would have
   dismissed it as one man’s opinion had that gentleman not initiated a
   conversation in Bengali with other people present in the coach and
   informed me that each and every one of the 6 passengers sitting across
   from us also supported Narendra Modi to become India’s Prime Minister.
   One among those 6 gentlemen had actually attended the NaMo rally which
   had occured at Brigade ground.

   “Many people of the Trinamool Congress also attended the rally. It has
   made a HUGE impact. Modi is an outsider but we really liked the fact
   that he reached out to us and addressed us. If you want our vote you
   should give us this much respect and Modi has done that. Things have
   changed significantly in entire Bengal after the Brigade.” said the
   gentleman who had attended the rally.

   As the train halted at the Howrah station in Kolkata, I got a call from
   a gentleman in his early 40s. He was an RSS man who had himself offered
   to pick me up from the station. An offer which I had shameless accepted
   without even pretending to show reluctance. :P This gentleman owns a
   food business which employs more than a hundred people. And yet not a
   shred of arrogance or ego could be sensed in him. Thus it was
   embarrassing for me when he apologized to me for “inconveniencing me”
   for coming late. Quite frankly I don’t even bother picking up my own
   brother from the airport when he comes once a year from Europe. But
   next time I will.

   As we traveled in his car, we started discussing local Kolkata and
   Bengal politics. It was surprising for me to find out how much
   polarization had taken place in Bengal and how much demographic changes
   had occurred. Of course violence in Bengal during elections was not
   unheard of. (Violence is a by product of socialism/communism. Communism
   basically kills your ambition and you accept your fate. When you you
   don’t expect anything much from life, you can get frustrated which can
   lead to violence. )

   In the evening, I went to Kalighat where volunteers of Mission 272+ had
   gathered and were doing a campaign event. This was right opposite to
   the famous Kalighat temple. The area is also generally considered to be
   a Trinamool den since Mamata Didi lives there.  There was a big canopy
   of Mission 272+, a tea vendor who was selling tea. A desk outside the
   canopy where a man was speaking out loud something in Bengali. I could
   understand a few words since Bengali has its origins in Hindi only. And
   then the BJP candidate, Tathagat Roy came amidst chants of “Swagatam
   Swagatam”. And he held an interactive discussion with the people. In
   the meantime, 5-6 well educated, professionals wearing “NaMo” Tshirts
   started to handout pamphlets chanting “Vote for Modi, Vote for Modi”
   and “Aibar Modi Aibar Modi (Whatever that means)”. What was interesting
   to note was that people who took the leaflets did not take simply throw
   them away but took their time reading it.

   Vivek Singh, one of the coordinators of Mission 272+, while
   distributing pamphlets, chanced upon a very old gentleman who-if I
   understood it right- said that his income will increase if Modi would
   come. You may also look at the below video to understand what I am
   talking about. I captured the whole event in my camera. Do notice the
   people reading the leaflets.

   This Mission 272+ team organizes multiple events on a daily basis in
   different parts of Kolkata and have interacted with several lacs of
   people already. The one thing where the BJP is lacking right now in
   Kolkata is the booth management on the final day. If the BJP is able to
   cover that base (and things are looking bright), nothing can
   stop it from emerging as a major force in 2014 in West Bengal.

[38]The Meaning of “Vote for India”

   [39]February 22, 2014September 19, 2014 [40]Politics, [41]Uncategorized

   Vote for India is a slogan which has been given by Narendra Modi for
   the upcoming 2014 elections. I have always found this slogan to be
   intriguing and it took me some time to interpret it. I have now defined
   the meaning of Vote for India in 2 ways:
    1. We are choosing our Prime Minister. In these elections, we are
       voting  to choose our head of state and not the head of our
       particular constituency. Whenever something bad happens, we blame
       our Prime Minister and not our MP. Till about a few months ago, I
       didn’t even know who my MP was to be honest. Hence if we can get
       wise, we should ONLY consider who our Prime Minister will when we
       go out and vote for an election symbol. The candidate should not
       matter.
    2. We are not voting to solve our day to day life problems such as
       water supply, or drainage but are voting to solve national problems
       such as corruption, unemployment, slow economic growth, and
       external threats. Hence instead of voting for our constituency or
       our state, we are “Voting for India”. Because if India’s
       fundamental problems are solved, then only will our lives get
       better.

   If the meaning of “Vote for India” can be communicated to the people
   effectively, there is no force on earth or heaven which can stop
   Narendra Modi from becoming the next Prime Minister of India.

[43]Time For BJP to Sell the “Lotus Flower” Symbol to People

   [44]February 20, 2014September 19, 2014 [45]Politics

   With country gearing up for 2014 elections, Narendra Modi seems to have
   become the default choice for the Prime Minister’s post. The Congress
   has given up the race and so has the left front and even AAP voter has
   been rendered thoroughly disappointed after Arvind Kejriwal’s
   incompetence to administer (apart from his nautanki) was recently
   exposed.

   While the BJP has to a very large extent succeeded in selling Narendra
   Modi, it’s now important for it to complement that effort by also
   making the Lotus Flower, the symbol of change. Ultimately, the Lotus
   Flower symbolizes the BJP and it is the BJP candidates in different Lok
   Sabha constituencies which will ensure that Narendra Modi ultimately
   becomes the Prime Minister of the country. So how can the BJP sell
   lotus flower? There are several ways to do that and not surprisingly,
   it is Narendra Modi himself who is leading the effort.

   a) Local Mission X Lotuses: In his Odisha rally recently, Narendra Modi
   demanded 21 Lotuses from the people of Odisha so that he has a clear
   channel to work for the development of Odisha. The same strategy can be
   adopted by BJP groundworkers at the local level where each state can
   start its own Mission X Lotuses. For example, the state of UP can begin
   Mission 80 Lotuses.  Odisha can start 21 Lotuses and so on. This way
   the workers will have a goal in mind and will feel accountable towards
   that goal.

   b) Lotus Flower as a brand: Kamal Sandesh is the name of a monthly BJP
   newsletter that is mailed to BJP members. Just like Kamal Sandesh, we
   can have several commodities like Kamal kameez, kamal topi, kamal cups,
   or even kamal chhap “jhadu”. ;)

   c) Campaign called “Why vote for Lotus” can be launched immediately
   asking people why they will vote for Lotus. Videos can be recorded and
   a prize can be given to the person who gives the best response. This
   will be something like the “Mere Sapno Ka Bharat” campaign.

   d) Goddess Laxmi who is generally associated with wealth also depicted
   standing on a Lotus flower. Thus wealth can be equated with the Lotus.

   If Narendra Modi was the BJP’s election symbol, then no campaign would
   have been necessary. But since the election symbol is the lotus flower
   it’s time the BJP supporters realize the gap in their campaign. The
   sooner the Lotus flower symbol and BJP becomes synonymous with NaMo,
   the easier it will get to win the booths on the election day!

[47]Not Modi, it’s Indians who need History Lessons

   [48]November 1, 2013September 19, 2014 [49]Politics, [50]Uncategorized

   When you read something like this from a prominent Indian artist

     . Takshila is in Bihar which was invaded by Sikander. Chandragupt
     was from Gupta dynasty.Nehru should not have been the 1st PM.
     Perfect !!

     — Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) [51]October 31, 2013

   , “you” are bound to feel that Modi might have made a blooper during
   his Hunkaar rally speech. I am going to ignore what the Times of India
   said about the so-called bloopers but I think Mr Javed Akhtar
   definitely can do with some history lessons. I put the word “you” in
   quotes because if this is the level of a so called eminent Indian, I
   shudder to think what chapters do Indians remember from history. Take
   Chandragupta for example, this is what Modi said about him:

   IFRAME:
   [52]http://www.youtube.com/embed/j8ont7QjwS0?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&shows
   earch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&start=338&wmode=transparent

   So here’s what he said “Agar Gupta vansh ko yaad karein, toh
   Chandragupt ki raajneeti humein prerna deti hai.”

   What most Indians don’t know (or don’t remember) is that apart from the
   Maurya Dynasty, there was another dynasty known as the Gupta dynasty
   whose founder was also known as Chandragupta. Coincidentally, this
   dynasty was also based out of Patliputra (modern day Patna). As per
   wikipedia, Chandragupta I “is known for forging alliances with many
   powerful families in the Ganges region.”
   [53]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_I

   While the Mauryan King Chandragupt Maurya, the grandfather of Asoka and
   the protege of Chanakya, was a great conqueror, he wasn’t exactly known
   for his “politics” whereas Chandragupta, the founder of the Gupta
   Empire built his empire with a combination of tactfulness and
   aggression.

   Hence what Modi said made 100% sense to those of us who remember our
   history, but the incident shows how much ignorance prevails in India
   today so much so that even prominent people like Javed Akhtar get
   confused and sadly, start mocking people without verifying.

   In my next post, I will tell you how stupid you are when you mock Modi
   because he mentioned Taxila.

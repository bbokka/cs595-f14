   Published on Apr 9, 2013

   Lyrics below. This is an original song written and composed by me,
   though it's not complete this is a rough draft that will soon be
   revised and posted on my friend's account. Sorry there's no video, but
   the guitar shown is the same used in the recording. Recorded March 27,
   2013 on the iPhone 5 voice memo. Enjoi
   You shine even before the rising sun
   Golden rays beam from within, the beauty of being a genuine one
   So far away, yet held so close
   With our time we'll make the most
   Riding along this wave of euphoria
   Soaring into those misty blues
   Oh you calm the storm that is my mind
   One touch is all it takes to freeze time
   Thoughts become words and turn into feelings
   I could spend all night lookin' up at this ceiling
   Chorus
   Tell me, what about you?
   Tell me what will you do?
   Will you please these demons?
   Or find a reason to fade away?
   I know these thoughts have seen light before
   But there's no, way I could feel, anymore
   An escape from reality seemed near impossible
   Happiness from within, at last is probable
   Testing these waters with diluted intentions
   Two minds become one, there's no prevention
   We're riding along this wave of euphoria
   Soaring into those misty blues
   Bodies tangled and intertwined, but that's alright
   I hope to never see an end to this night
   Something tells me to just stay here
   Yet we both know our futures are near
   Oh there's such power in this wave's crash
   Let it was over me, there's nothin' I could do, but laugh
   Chorus

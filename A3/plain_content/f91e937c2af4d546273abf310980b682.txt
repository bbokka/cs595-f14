[51]#InstaNicki: Nicki Minaj Behind-The-Scenes at MTV EMA's 2014 Promo Shoot
       Posted by User
       Not only will Nicki Minaj be performing at the 2014 MTV EMAs —
       she's hosting the whole shebang, and recently shared her excitement
       by posting two behind-the-scenes pictures (via Instagram) from a
       photo shoot for a commercial that's expected to air soon for the
       award show.
       She also took some time to remind us why she's the best b*tch doin'
       it, by posting a third photo with the caption: "Today ANACONDA
       becomes my longest solo #1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip Hop chart.
       (Moment4Life spent 5 weeks at #1 on this chart). It's also still #1
       on the Rap chart after 6 weeks and #3 on the HOT 100. **** Flawless
       Remix is #3 on Urban radio with no video and no iTunes. Touchin
       Lovin with Trey Songz top 10 on Rhythmic Radio with no video...
       (Video Coming Soon) *swivels in chair* And now for the weather..."
       Check out the photos below.

[54]Nicki Minaj To Host MTV Europe Music Awards In Glasgow
       Posted by User
       MAJOR breaking news: MTV have announced that none other than Nicki
       Minaj will be the host of their 20th anniversary EMA gala in
       Glasgow! Plus, the hip-hop superstar will be performing at the
       show.
       Nicki treated us to a no-holds-barred performance of 'Anaconda' at
       the VMAs in August, and there's no telling what she'll do when
       she's in the spotlight at the SSE Hydro. This will be her debut
       appearance at the EMAs, and we can bet it'll be a memorable one.
       She's also up for four awards—Best Female, Best Hip Hop, Biggest
       Fans and Best Look—so there's a chance she'll take center stage as
       a host, a performer, AND a winner.
       It's all going down at 9pm CET on 9 November—just 2 weeks before
       Nicki releases her 3rd studio album, 'The Pinkprint'. You don't
       want to miss this epic extravaganza!

[61]#InstaNicki: Nicki Minaj Posts Selfies In New Wig
       Posted by User
       Nicki Minaj had instagram in a frenzy when she posted a pair of
       boobilicious selfies on Sunday. In the photos she shows us her
       flawless make up, short black bob wig and sexy bra — which
       according to her, are all a part of a "secret project."
       "Thx 4 my makeup Uza, short bob by Oscar, bra by my crazy "mother"
       Rushka #ItsASecret," she captioned one of the photos.
       What do you think the secret is barbz? A photo shoot, video shoot
       or something else?

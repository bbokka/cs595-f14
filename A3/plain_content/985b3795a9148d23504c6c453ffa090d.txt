[13]Choices

   I’ve been doing alot of thinking since i went back to school last
   month. And i’ve come to the conclusion that you can’t have a career and
   a family at the same time as a woman. You have to make a choice about
   what’s more important to you because something will suffer as you try
   to do both.

   All the friends that i have that didn’t have kids at a young age are
   fairly career oriented and consumed in their jobs. They work hours upon
   hours, make excellent money, drive nice cars, have nice houses, but
   something’s missing. Most of them don’t have serious relationships
   because no one wants to come second to their girlfriend’s career.

   Then i look at my friends and myself that have children, that had them
   before their careers started. We struggle. We sacrifice. But we love. I
   love my daughter to the moon and back. She makes me feel like going on
   when i would normally give up, lock myself in a closet and blow my
   brains on the walls. But i continually ask myself, am i doing the right
   thing? Do i suck as a mom? Am i being neglectful? Do i have the correct
   balance?

   All of the decisions i make are based on whether or not there is
   longevity. I am one of the most indecisive people i know, yet when i
   finally do decide, it’s for real. I decided to go back to school
   because I can’t get comfortable in my position because there is no
   upward movement without further education. And i knew i didn’t want to
   do the same routine everyday for the next 40 years.

   However, i feel like a terrible mother. I only see my daughter for a
   few hours in the morning before school, and a few hours after school
   before bed. I work every single solitary weekend so i don’t get to see
   her then. I keep telling myself that it’s only temporary, and the
   benefits outweigh the costs, but in the back of my mind i’m asking if
   this is really true. I feel like i’m missing out on so many of the
   little, yet important pieces of her elementary school life. I don’t
   want to be so consumed in myself and my education that i wake up and my
   daughter is a teenager that hates me because i was never there for her.

   So, i kind of understand the reason that most women wait until they’re
   settled in their career before deciding to get married and having kids.
   However, then your faced with the dilemma of advanced maternal age, as
   well as the glass ceiling. No one wants a woman executive that has to
   take maternity leave, call off for a sick child, leave early to attend
   their child’s sporting event, or come in to work late because their
   child was bawling their eyes out when mom dropped them off at daycare.

   We are forced to choose what aspect is more important to us. And pray
   that we don’t regret our decision when it’s all said and done. I pray
   that one day all of these dilemmas will be obsolete, that one day we as
   women will be able to successfully find the balance between career and
   family. Until then, i tell women to think hard, think deep, but follow
   your heart. One day it will all make sense. I hope.

[16]Doing the right for the wrong

   The right thing to do is so wrong. People sacrifice their lives, sense
   of self and happiness for the wrong people.

   Men-women too, but mostly men. Staying with women you really don’t want
   to be with to keep the ‘family’ together. You don’t want society to
   call you a deadbeat, or have the world think you walked out on your
   kid(s). You don’t want the mom to try to use the child(ren) as a weapon
   against you because that just gets ugly.

   Women-men too, but mostly women. Sticking with a man you know ain’t
   shit. Trying to change someone you know damn well doesn’t want to
   change because that’s who you want to be with. But who are you?
   Supreme? Almighty? NO! You are a person put in situations in life to be
   tested. You determine whether you pass or fail. Just because you think
   you’re doing the right thing doesn’t mean you automatically pass.
   Sometimes you have to walk away because it can make you stronger.
   Whereas if you stay you could be perceived as weak because you aren’t
   willing to take the steps. Now these subjects can be argued until we
   are all blue in the face. It’s a catch 22. Damned if you do, damned if
   you don’t. Weak if you walk away, strong if you stay?

   The reality of it all is this: people only do what you let them. While
   you think you are the strong person sticking it out, the other person
   thinks you are weak because they know you won’t go anywhere no matter
   what they do to you. Did you ever think of it that way? Yeah, me
   either.

   I’ve been on both sides. I wanted the whole family thing to work out,
   but it wasn’t right for me and I couldn’t fake it. Sometimes you just
   have to realize that you aren’t meant to be and the reason you were
   brought together was to create the beautiful being that you have. Now I
   know, back in the day, this that & the third…but let’s be serious. More
   children today have parents that aren’t together than those that are.
   Not justifying broken homes, just stating they are prevalent & no
   longer taboo. It’s not gonna kill anyone.

   I also had a ‘ain’t shit nigga.’ He put his thing in anything and lied
   about it. But i stayed true, aside from a few indiscretions of my own,
   which I, unlike him, told the truth about. I thought that if i
   continued to be to him what i wanted him to be to me, that one day he
   would wake up and see he didn’t need anyone but me. Didn’t work. Oddly
   enough, I’m just fine.

   It’s funny how you have someone you think you can’t live without no
   longer in your life and you see how much better things are and can be.
   Then you sit back and think, well shit I shoulda been done this! Lol.
   Just remember: everything that’s good to ya ain’t good for ya. Do what
   makes you truly happy because in the end, all the people in your
   business eventually have to worry about themselves and their own damn
   problems one day.

   Peace & Love

[19]Lifestyles of the not single and shameless

   So normally I hate talk radio.  I listen to the radio to hear the
   music.  I don’t give a shit about the gossip of who did what to whom
   and why.  However, as I was flipping through my channels on XM
   something caught my ear.  This guy was on there talking about how he
   was in a relationship but was cheating on his girlfriend with multiple
   chicks.  First and foremost…I hope that his girlfriend wasn’t listening
   and heard this, because if I was her I would have pulled a Lefteye
   (RIP) on his ass.  Bleach and flames, bleach and flames.  I digress…

   He proceeds to tell the radio host that he cheats on his girl because
   she won’t give it to him and all this and that.  He cheats on a regular
   basis, yada yada.  So the host asks him if that’s the case then why
   doesn’t he just man up and tell her he’s not happy and leave her.  This
   nigga had the nerve to say “I don’t think she could handle it.”  Child
   please!  The host told him that he was selfish and he was probably the
   one who wouldn’t be able to handle it.  See I’m not even going to make
   this a male bashing post, because females do it to.  So what I’m going
   to say is going to apply to everyone.

   YOU MOTHERFUCKERS ARE SELFISH.  Bottom line.  All you people out here
   cheating on your significant others because you don’t want them but
   don’t want anyone else to have them are ruining it for genuine and
   loyal people like myself.  When I am in a relationship I am devoted to
   that person and that person only.  As long as that man is playing his
   part in all aspects, then there is no need for me to go elsewhere.  If
   I feel I need to go elsewhere, then I need to re-evaluate my
   relationship.  The re-evaluation comes with communication of the things
   that I feel are lacking in my relationship to my man, and if he decides
   to change and step it up then good, if not then see ya.  It’s not
   really that cut and dry and easy, but it is what it is and it works.

   People that just want to test the waters and dip and dab in this and
   that need NOT be in a relationship.  I swear I see so many people in
   relationships doing more single things than the single people that I
   know are just dealing with one person.  It’s really sickening and it’s
   unfair.  However, I have to blame the significant others at one point
   because PEOPLE ONLY DO WHAT YOU LET THEM.  So if you let them cheat and
   take them back without making them deal with what they did, then of
   course they are going to do it over and over and over and over again.
   So in all actuality it isn’t just that one person’s fault.

   In a relationship, that person should be the first and last person you
   think of when waking and going to sleep, your best friend, your
   confidant, your lover, your everything and your one and only.  If you
   feel that they cannot fill one of these aspects and you venture outside
   of your union then you are no longer considered to be in a relationship
   in my eyes.  You cannot be in a relationship with more than one person,
   unless you are a polygamist and the outside parties all know about each
   other and are okay with it like in other countries.  But let’s be
   serious.  NO ONE IS OKAY WITH THAT!  Do you realize how much shit goes
   down from people cheating.  You got people checking cell phones and
   calling numbers, stalking and showing up at places unannounced,
   fighting, stabbing, shooting, all kinda shit because people want to
   share the shit thats in their pants with everyone.  And continuously
   failing at trying to be sneaky about it at that.

   A lot of people seem to thing that people can’t handle the truth.
   However, lies are way more detrimental.  Just think about if you were a
   man, and you were with a girl, and she cheated on you but never told
   you,.  You guys have a kid that you think is yours, he gets sick and
   needs a blood transfusion, you go to donate and find out that you nor
   your girl have the same blood type as the child. NOT TELLING IS JUST AS
   BAD AS BLATANT LYING.

   From my experience and friendships with males, guys hurt way worse when
   they find out that their girl is being piped down by the next nigga.
   So while your slipping and sliding with the next, why don’t you thing
   about how you would feel if your significant other was sharing the
   things that you are sharing with the person you’re laying beside for
   the temporary.  Think about your girl lettin some other dude put his
   mouth on “your” pussy.  Or better yet your girl putting her mouth on
   his dick.  Then think about the fact that when she gets home, she might
   let you put your mouth back on that pussy that he had his mouth and
   dick in earlier that day.  Disgusting right?  And ladies, you think its
   okay for him to come home and let you put your mouth on his dick that
   he just had in the next girl’s pussy right?  You people wonder why STDs
   are so rampant these days.  Regardless of whether you’re strapping up
   or not, I never seen anyone put a condom or a diaphragm on their mouth.

   Shit is real out here, and in all honesty sometimes cheating doesn’t
   fall mainly on the sexual aspect of the relationship.  Sometimes there
   is a gap in communication between two people and they venture to an
   outside source to vent, to talk to, to befriend.  They get  closer,
   then one day they end up having sex, and it stems from there into a
   crazy fucked up situation.  However, what does the problem come from?
   COMMUNICATION.  Like I said earlier, your mate should be your
   confidant.  If you have a problem with them that you feel that you
   cannot discuss with them, that you have to talk to with someone else,
   there enlies your dilemma.  If you cannot attack your problem at the
   source, there will be more problems to come.

   I’ve always tried to be as up front and honest about things as
   possible, and even when I tried to hide things they eventually ended up
   surfacing because I have a hell of a guilty conscience.  I used to get
   my ass WHOOPED as a child for lying about the smallest things, so
   honesty is a big thing with me.  Sometimes people feel as though they
   will be and are punished for lying, but in all actualilty, who can be
   mad at you for “keeping it 100?”  It might sting for a second, but once
   the person sits and thinks about it they have no choice but to respect
   you for respecting them enough to tell them the truth.  And if they are
   a real person they should have no problem with you telling them how it
   is.  If they seem to have a problem with you telling the truth, then
   they have some issues of their own that they need to iron out then get
   back to you.

   Sorry if things were a little graphic this time around but hey, we’re
   all adults here.  People need to do some serious deep thinking about
   this relationship shit, and communicate better with their mates to they
   are in the know.  Nobody likes to find out shit about someone they’re
   dealing with by accident.  Yeezy said it best, “…and deception is the
   worst felony, so never fuck nobody without tellin me…”  I’m out.

[22]Love…

   …is so real. Like it’ll have you on a whole different level of life.
   But the timing has to be right or it won’t work.

   Before, i’d be the type to just walk when things don’t go my way. I
   hear some shit i don’t like, or feel like i’m in danger of being hurt.
   However, walking away due to fear can cause you to miss something.

   So instead of taking a walk, we talk. Straighten each other out, put
   all the cards on the table. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. What’s understood
   doesn’t need explained. We been here this long right? We had time to
   see what life was like without one another and decided that it was just
   so unbearable. Lol

   So instead of worrying about what DID happen or what COULD happen or
   what WILL happen, let’s focus on what IS HAPPENING. We are building. We
   are accomplishing our goals. We are each other’s voice of reason,
   coach, spine, etc. If we won’t let one another give up on what we want
   in life, why would we give up on each other?

   Things don’t always go as planned. One thing i do know is that i won’t
   allow myself to be the cause for things falling apart. If i don’t see
   it with my eyes or hear it with my ears i’m not worried. I’m going to
   continue to do the right thing regardless because i know i am
   appreciated for such.

[25]What is it you really want?

   Everyone says the want someone that is independant and successful, but
   they resent all the time and work it takes to get there…u know the
   saying, ‘a man with time has no money, and a man with money has no
   time’…

   I’ve always considered myself 2nd or 3rd in line to my counterpart’s
   life. First and foremost will be his career. If he has nothing to work
   for or towards, why should i want him? If he has to put in long late
   hour to reach his dream, why should i complain? It won’t always be that
   way! You have to think towards the future, instead of the now. No
   complaining or nagging that he doesn’t have time for you! Instead, make
   it easier for him. Appreciate the time you do get. Whether a 5 minute
   random phone call, or a short 30 minute lunch date. Cherish those
   seconds you were there at his side watching him put that work in. It
   will make those moments more valuable once he makes it to his destiny.
   Ride out for that man as he’s climbing that ladder. Be by his side. He
   may need you to whisper words of encouragement in his ear when he feels
   like giving up. I promise he won’t forget it.

   If he has kid(s) they damn sure better be second! If you put me before
   your kids we won’t make it to the front door. Nothing besides the money
   to take care of that baby should come between them. Bottom line. No
   ifs, ands, or maybes.

   I came up with this hierarchy because that’s how i live my life. I
   can’t take care of my baby with no money in my pocket. Best believe i’m
   gonna ride the money train til the wheels fall off. I’m always striving
   for better, looking to advance, and thinking towards the future. After
   all those long days of work, seeing the smile on my baby’s face and
   hearing ‘i missed you so much mommy’, nothing matters in the world, and
   i know i’m doing the right thing. And once i find the man who
   understands where he fits in and plays his role accordingly, the puzzle
   will be complete.

   So be careful what you wish for. Don’t say you want someone or some
   thing that you’re not willing to stick around for when the going gets
   rough. Nothing worth having is easy, and nothing easy is worth having.
   Remember that.

[28]Pressure

   Women are crazy. We want what we want when we want it. And when we
   don’t get it we complain, pout and bitch. But while we’re doing these
   things, being unappreciative, and worrying about what we don’t
   have…ANOTHER BITCH is appreciating what we do have.

   So what if he doesn’t do it the way you expect him to. It’s easy to
   tell if a man is being genuine in his efforts. And if he is doing
   everything in his power to keep that smile on your face, HOW DARE YOU
   expect more from him? No two people think alike. Not even twins. And
   men are the furthest thing from mind readers. But they’re not stupid.

   How long have we known that it takes men longer to mature than women?
   So what makes you think that because you’re ready to take it to the
   next level that he is??? First of all, communication is KEY. Closed
   mouths don’t get fed, however if you keep your mouth open too long
   you’re gonna catch a fly. So chill. Let him know what’s up, but don’t
   demand a thing. And if you feel like you need to move on then go. But
   don’t get mad when you see the next bitch on your boo because you got
   impatient and bounced. Been there, done that.

   Realize this, you can’t make a man make a move when he’s not ready.
   Recipe for disaster. That’s like merging on a crowded expressway. You
   make that man feel like he has no choice or you’re giving ultimatums
   he’ll resist. Give him some space, let him know what it’s like to miss
   you. And he’ll either A-realize he can’t live without you, or B-say
   fuck it and be without you. But the choice is HIS! Why would you want
   to be with someone you MADE feel like they had no choice but to be with
   you?

   Don’t play too hard to get though because that’ll just turn him off and
   move him right along. Just put up enough resistance so that he knows
   you’re not to be fucked with. But also don’t be so caught up in what
   everyone else has going on. You don’t know if your friends are TRULY
   happy in their relationships. Don’t try to force some shit just to be
   part of the crowd. Dare to be different. If people worried about
   themselves as much as they worried about everyone else, we’d all be
   better off.

   Stop spending so much time thinking about what you don’t have,
   appreciate what you do…and if you feel its not enough then weigh the
   costs an benefits, then decide. Don’t be stupid, know your worth. But
   most importantly remember this: just because he doesn’t love you the
   way YOU expect him to doesn’t mean he’s not loving you the best way he
   knows how.

[31]Communication

   I don’t need a title to be faithful. I need boundaries. I was loyal to
   a man that wasn’t mine. Well, not only mine. But i was loyal because i
   was happy. All i need to know is your expectations of me and i will
   fulfill. However, the not knowing is what gets me into trouble. I’m not
   your girl, you’re not my man…u do u, i do me, sometimes we do each
   other…then u do her, i’m doin him…fuck no.

   I just want to know. What are we doing? What do you want from me? I
   don’t need to be anyone’s girlfriend. The thought of a title terrifies
   me. However i’d like to know that you’d rather i not go to dinner with
   other guys, or text someone else all day & night. You want me to be
   real with you and i will. I’ll tell u straight up that i wouldn’t like
   it if you did something and tell you why.

   The thing is double standards run rampant and have since the beginning
   of time. I’m supposed to not be your girl but i’m not supposed to
   entertain other men while you’re poking your penis in every dark hole
   you see? Humph. Now don’t get me wrong, i don’t wanna slide on every
   hard dick in a 20 mile radius, but i damn sure ain’t bouta put all my
   eggs in one basket. The only way that’ll happen is if I KNOW ITS FOR
   REAL. Like w/o a shadow of a doubt, u for me n me for u. But people are
   so caught up in their pasts it rarely gets to that point.

   We as men & women are so caught up in who hurt us that we won’t give
   the next person the chance to do us RIGHT! I am the queen of
   relationship sabotage. That’s why i tend to not ask questions because i
   end up pissed at the answer. Or i get lied to. So fuck it, if it’s
   meant for me to know i’ll find out eventually.

   Unfortunately love & feelings aren’t as black and white as we wish for
   them to be, and emotions tend to turn shit into madness. However, if we
   would be straight up in the beginning, lay all our cards out, express
   our expectations, and go from there it may be alot better. But really,
   what are the chances of that happening? So we sit & wait and expect
   each other to read our minds & think how we think. And end up slashing
   tires, busting windows, and talkin shit about each other via social
   network.

[5]Osian Finn Arthur Böber

   On the 22 July 2014 around 22:30h my second son was born, Osian Finn
   Arthur Böber. It is a joy to be a dad doubly so.

[10]Fitness Update...

   My plan over last nine months has been attempting to get into good
   shape. It is only a year and three months until I'm forty and so never
   have been more serious. Being a father helps make one become painfully
   aware of their own vices and cultural procrastination.
   A false start at Virgin Gym finally led me to [11]Forest Gym in Tilgate
   Park, upon the recommendation of a few folk within Crawley.
   It isn’t that I have an aversion to commercial gyms, but I don't
   necessarily belief that they encourage a person to fitness. Tending
   only to be full of only meat-heads (you can spot them for their over
   developed arms, no shoulders, weak backs and spindly legs), or
   otherwise populated by preening narcissists whose puffed up self-image
   and range of hair products are move important to them than their health
   and fitness. Conversely, I may just be a bitter ageing baldy who has
   the sort of middle-class education that makes him condescendingly smug,
   pouring scorn at others lifestyle decisions, albeit entirely sneering
   at own as well. After all, it would hardly be fair if one wasn't down
   on oneself as well.
   Nonetheless, Forest Gym provides the sort of environment which
   commercial franchises fail. It provides an identity. Whilst it is a
   foremost a bodybuilding gym it remains entirely old-fashioned in its
   feel. A refurbed hut in the middle of a forest. Equipment without brand
   names. Tepid showers. A staffy dog lacking one eye and the ability to
   walk. A South African manager, [12]Harold "Big H" Marillier, who is an
   [13]IFBB pro that has another job of restoring historic military tanks.
   It is an extremely supportive environment used by a lot of bodybuilding
   pro's, which has the advantage of there being people who are able to
   assist you in correct and effect techniques. You have to bear in mind
   that bodybuilding techniques has greatly influences all areas of
   athletics. Nevertheless, it is inspiring and at times worrying. Just
   the sort of environment I prefer. Some people, both men and women, have
   trained their bodies to repulsively colossal proportions.
   My interest here is the [14]Grecian Ideal, which is wholly divorced
   from the monsters which are too often associated to contemporary
   bodybuilding. I am more a realist that, as with my weight loss, this is
   also something which needs to be progressive for it to be sustainable,
   and not something rapid which can be lost as fast as it is gained.
   I'm presently facing the toughest challenge of nutrition. It's 75% of
   the battle and whilst I don't have an unhealthy diet neither do I have
   a selectively healthy one. It would be logically for me to return to a
   vegetarian diet, albeit one in which every month I have at least four
   high-quality meat meals. It’s going to tough but then getting older
   isn’t any easier.
   Otherwise, progress is good and muscle is developing. I will get some
   photos up here to show the progress over the course of a year. Contrast
   is all important.
   But, it is then the particular application of this. I would like to do
   the [15]Mens Health Survival of the Fitness possibly this year. I’ve
   been doing some running around the rec ground close to my house, but
   need to build this up to some decent sort of distances. Typically I do
   a 30-45min set on a standing bicycle once a week to also build up my
   cardio and stamina. I’d like to think I could nail something like this
   before I’m 40, not least as progress means I’ll prob be fitter in my
   40s than in pervious decades. There are some runs in Sussex which I am
   tempting to test the water with. But I like the idea of a run having
   obstacles within it as well. Link

[27]High Intensity Training (HIT)

   Just to make clear at this juncture the motivations for my training:

    1. I am turning 38. The closer I get to that 40 landmark the more
       serious I know I need to sort out my health for the sort of sailing
       I want to make thereafter. There are a number of physiological
       factors – such as from 40-70 you will loose 50% of you flexibility,
       muscle development, increase fat in arteries etc. – which can be
       prevented with simple exercise.
    2. I am a [28]Chartered Safety & Health Practitioner. I think it is
       critical point that often too much attention is given to the
       “safety” and not enough to the “health”. I’m also a [29]Fellow of
       the [30]Royal Society for Public Health. It would utterly
       incongruous to be all this and unfit. Therefore a principled
       philosophical assertion must be that to inspire others to improve
       their health in simple and practical ways – not only in a gym but
       in other [31]gym-free lifestyle choices – then I must be as I say.
       More so.
    3. I have committed myself to the [32]Men Health ‘Survival of the
       Fittest’ in Edinburgh this year. 10km with 10 obstacles. There will
       be more challenges like this and I’ve been looking at those
       arranged out on the South Downs. I am twist the arm of my old
       friend, [33]Mark Habben, at the [34]Zoological Society of London,
       to coach me up on running. Since his since recovering from cancer
       he has become a virtual [35]Lance Armstrong.
    4. I shall be making a debut return to the rock. Given that I am
       moving into Sussex soon it puts me right on the door step on my old
       stomping ground – [36]Harrison Rocks and [37]Stone Farm. For this I
       need my weight-strength not only to be correct but better than it
       use to be. I’m a member of the [38]British Mountaineering Council
       so it’s my duty to climb. Badly.
    5. I’m a [39]Fellow of the [40]Royal Geographical Society. I’m
       supposed to be spending more time outside, more time training, and
       less time in an arm-chair. However, am armchair is a lovely
       [41]oxblood Queen Anne Chesterfield, so it is easy to spend so much
       time in it.
    6. I have a son now. I want to inspire him to be fit, strong and
       healthy. Who wouldn’t want that?

   To achieve all this I took an off-peak membership with [42]Virgin
   Active a couple of months back, which as a membership package perfectly
   suits my work lunch breaks.

   Routine is:

   - 6min walk to the Gym,

   - 5mins to change and prep,

   - 30mins session – concentrating on 7-9 sets,

   - 10 mins to shower and change,

   - 6min brisk walk back to the office.

   NB: The nice part about the brisk walk is that it functions as an easy
   warm-up and cool-down.

   I’m presently going through a break-in period for at least another two
   month to build up the my foundation strength, thereafter I’ll be
   dropping to fewer than five working sets per session with a longer rest
   period - necessitating 4–7 days of recovery before the next workout.

   Naturally, the last week has been manic due to the birth of Elijah so I
   dropped only to one session per week – but increased the intensity,
   with surprising results.

   The program I am working to in adaption outlined in [43]High-Intensity
   Training the Mike Mentzer Way. [44]Mike Mentzer was an American former
   IFBB professional bodybuilder, businessman, and author. Having read
   much of his work it is quick to recognize that he was much more than
   that. AS contrived as it seems he was also a philosopher and
   [45]Objectivist.

   He was one of those all-round Americans which are increasingly becoming
   a dying breed, or simply have become increasingly less vocal.
   Regardless of some minor ideological differences – although largely
   cultural due to my own cheerless sense of Europeanism engrained within
   me – it would have been nice to have made contact with Mentzer before
   his untimely death. Still, it is nice to think that a generation of
   meat-heads has been fed a philosophical approach to existence rather
   than just a gym regime.

   According to Mentzer, biologists and physiologists since the nineteenth
   century have known that hypertrophy - that is the biological process by
   which to increase of the size of muscle cells – is directly related to
   intensity, not duration, of effort. Most bodybuilding and weightlifting
   authorities do not take into account the severe nature of the stress
   imposed by heavy, strenuous resistance exercise carried to a point of
   positive muscular failure.

   For me, the program is working well. I may have moderately slight
   advantage with my genetic heritage – predominately East Anglian,
   Cumbrian and [46]Litvak – which has expressed itself with quick
   muscular development, but the radical stuff won’t show for months. I
   think it may be good to take photos of these changes so there is a
   visual record for this.

   All going according to plan, then I will towards the end of year I will
   change from Virgin to [47]Forest Gym – the facility is more in-tune
   with what I need from a sporting perspective, a training regime and
   fiscally. Afterall, it will be counterproductive to hold a weekly
   membership to a gym I will only use once a week. The only thing I will
   need to do is get a collapsible bike of some sort to use to get from
   work to there – two fold benefit of my getting a bit of aerobic warm-up
   and being able to store the bike in my office. However, budgets
   permitting.

  [54]"Elijah James Keir Böber"

   Born on 01 April 2011 at around 0900h. The time is difficult to account
   for due to sleep deprivation as a result from the previous four days my
   wife was having contractions. The birth was fairly hellish for her as
   well. Poor Kate needed some surgery afterwards. But all is well with
   mum and baby.
   Registered him yesterday. Was slightly dumbfounded to know what I
   should put down as my profession, so it reads ‘Chartered Safety and
   Health Practitioner / Geographer’. Once and always both.
   The nice thing now is that he will get to grow up in Sussex and explore
   Ashdown Forest with me and his mum. Not so faraway to where we live.
   This means we can play pooh-sticks at [55]Pooh Sticks Bridge.
   If anyone is interested in a decent walk around East Grinstead which
   has a [56]Winnie the Pooh theme to it then check out the following link
   on the [57]Guardian.

[62]Claims managements with a dose of social history...

   I spent three hours this morning with a extremely nice solicitor who’d
   travelled all the way from Liverpool to Whipsnade assist over a couple
   of claims management issues. Dealing with third party claims is not an
   uncommon aspect of being a Chartered Safety & Health Practitioner. In
   fact it is almost expected condition of the profession. It is,
   afterall, what I’m chartered to do. That and send people off on
   international fieldwork.
   But some context is always need to be given to all this. More important
   specifically about what is required and what is urban myth or
   unrelated. Whilst it is easy to be trigger-happy when people hear the
   words “Health” and “Safety” it is worse when it is disregard in the
   face of growing fatality, injury and illness rates caused within
   workplace. [63]Key annual figures from 2008/09 included:
     * 1.2 million people who worked during the last year were suffering
       from an illness (long standing as well as new cases) they believed
       was caused or made worse by their current or past work. 551 000 of
       these were new cases.
     * 180 workers were killed at work, a rate of 0.6 per 100 000 workers.
     * 131 895 other injuries to employees were reported under [64]RIDDOR,
       a rate of 502.2 per 100 000 employees.
     * 246 000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force
       Survey, a rate of 870 per 100 000 workers.
     * 29.3 million days were lost overall (1.24 days per worker), 24.6
       million due to work-related ill health and 4.7 million due to
       workplace injury.

   The concept that employees should be safe at work is not a recent
   phenomenon. It dates back to The Factories Act 1802 (sometimes also
   called the "Health and Morals of Apprentices Act") which regulated
   factory conditions, especially in regard to child workers in cotton and
   woollen mills. The biggest revision being in 1844 when it recognised
   that:
     * Accidental death must be reported to a surgeon and investigated.
     * Thorough records must be kept regarding the provisions of the act.
     * Machinery was to be fenced in.

   Legislation was then developed in the 1970s to streamline the many
   different statutes governing safety issues which had developed since
   this period, and not least with the exponential growth of industry,
   which made management responsible for the provision and maintenance of
   adequate standards and policies. This ground-breaking and fundamental
   piece of legislation was perhaps unoriginally called the Health &
   Safety at Work Etc. Act 1974. The most curious part being the “Etc.”.
   Significantly it reads: "It shall be the duty of every employer to
   ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and
   welfare at work of all his employees"
   However whilst there are a vast number of different statutes governing
   safety issues - and you can almost certainly trust me that it really
   does feel exhaustingly vast sometimes - it is important to understand
   that health and safety isn’t singularly governed only by legislation.
   Under what is known as ‘common law’ all employers have a duty of care
   imposed on them to protect their employees. There is also a term
   implied into all employment contracts requiring employers to take care
   of their employees’ health and safety. Should an employer fail to take
   reasonable care in any of these areas, an employee may have a number of
   claims, including the ability to resign and claim constructive unfair
   dismissal and a personal injury claim in appropriate cases.
   Since the legalisation of 'no win no fee' arrangements (more accurately
   known as [65]Conditional Fee Agreements, and covered in more detail in
   an article elsewhere on this site), so-called claims management firms
   have become considerably more ubiquitous. These organisations arrange
   the entire process of claiming compensation, apparently simplifying
   what can otherwise be a difficult process. However, the merits of these
   organisations have been repeatedly called into question by commentators
   who suggest that they are exploiting those with legitimate claims and
   lessening the financial impact of any compensation that is granted.
   Third party claims also extend beyond the employer and to the owner as
   well. Much of what I can process as my casework is based on these. As
   the saying goes, from the absurd to the sublime.
   Best thing to do is keep your records, train your teams, checks things
   out, keep and eye on the horizon and remember that an inspection,
   investigation, claim or some sort of blame is always around the corner.
   Conversely, the same corner can bring you prosperity, good fortune and
   success. Just hard to say which will come along.

[72]Prosaic overview of the Blog

   So after some offs and ons I have finally given and and decide that I
   will write a blog. However, rather than the blethering of daily
   brain-farts I have made the reasoned decision to keep this update
   within five easily definitive areas:
   (i) My opinion as a [73]Chartered Safety & Health Practitioner – though
   I shall largely downplay this. It does mean I get to tick the
   “Professional” box in surveys though.
   (ii) How my fitness regime is progressing. The undertaking of my
   [74]High Intensity Training (HIT) program and the slow change from a
   not nearly healthy enough 37 year old to a more healthy 37 year old.
   Provided that I shall naturally age every year, which is preferred to
   unnaturally gaining, so I won’t be 37 years old forever which is
   perhaps reason enough to get fit.
   (iii) Climbs, Hikes , Trips and other adventures that I am engaged in,
   advising on – as a Fellow of the [75]Royal Geographical Society – or
   just impressed with.
   (iv) How my novel and other creative works are progressing.
   (v) How my knowledge of Socts Gaelic isn’t really progressing.

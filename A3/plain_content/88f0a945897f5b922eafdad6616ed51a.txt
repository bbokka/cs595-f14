      Hello!! So sorry I haven’t posted in a while.
      When I started this blog my goal was to fill a void in I saw in the
      world of fitness blogging.  Many fitness blogs just focus on the actual
      workout part. But I wanted to talk about the nuances that make your gym
      visits and workouts a little easier. In my first blog I wrote about
      topics I wanted to cover such as organising your gym bag, constructing
      a workout schedule and dealing with the hiccups that gym going can
      involve.
      Over the next year I wrote about running in the cold, contact lens
      wearing and the benefits of working with a personal trainer. But now I
      feel like I have said all I can say.
      I really want to thank everyone for reading and for all your lovely
      comments. I especially want to thank my editor (you know who you are).
      I am going to keep this blog up as a reminder to keep learning and keep
      having fun.
      If you have any questions or blog topics or anything you want me to try
      out, please don’t hesitate to connect with me.
      XO,
      Cindy

   [9]My thoughts on this year’s The Biggest Loser controversy

      02/18/2014

      [10]0 Comments

      Picture
      I wasn’t planning on writing about this, but after reading the online
      reaction, coupled with my own personal feelings about weight loss and
      my general hatred for the show, I feel like I should.
      As you all may have heard by now, The Biggest Loser has crowned their
      winner for [11]Season 15.
      I haven’t watched the show in a while, so I didn’t get to see Rachel’s
      journey. I won’t body shame her or anyone else. But let’s look at the
      show.
      The Biggest Loser is not about promoting weight loss. It’s a game show.
      You’re competing to see who loses the most weight. That’s a messed up
      premise, right there. Think about it, you’re competing against other
      people to lose weight not only for your own pride because you want to
      succeed, but also for bragging rights (because no one wants to get sent
      home).  It doesn’t matter that you’re being monitored by health
      specialists. This has to mess with your mind.
      Let’s talk about the workouts that the contestants are subjected to.
      Now, you all know I haven’t been working out that long. I have read
      articles how it takes years to be able to work out the way the
      contestants do on the show without injuring oneself. And apparently,
      people do get injured-[12]all the time.
      Apparently, if you go to The Biggest Loser resort [13]this is what your
      workout will look like. Imagine if they showed that on television?
      Bor-ing. Instead, the contestants are put through workouts that trained
      athletes probably wouldn’t do.
      Finally, let’s look at the trainers themselves. Apparently, they’re
      just awesome people in real life. But they’re contestants, too. They
      want bragging rights and sometimes that can lead to [14]cheating.
      But what does all this have to do with us? Sure you can boycott the
      show and advertisers or we can have a discussion about how the show
      impacts its audience.
      If you’re a parent who is afraid this show sends a bad message to your
      kids-educate them. Tell them the show is harmful and unrealistic, while
      watching it with them. Direct them to the Biggest Loser website and
      show them what life is really like at the ranch.
      Finally, don’t make the show bigger than it is. How you react to it has
      more impact on your child than the show ever could.

   [16]Easing back into  routine

      01/21/2014

      Picture
      Christmas Holidays 2011, I decided to take a two week break from
      working out. I lasted a week before I wanted to go back (I actually
      dreamed about working out). Last Christmas break I did manage to take
      the holidays off. It was great!
      The New Year came and went and I promised I would go back to my
      routine. I didn't have the same resolve that I had the previous year
      and anxieties about how crowded the gym would be hampered any
      enthusiasm I might have had. I also had anxiety about how hard I should
      work. My “break” was only two weeks, so I was able to ease back into a
      somewhat steady routine quite easily.
      But what if your break was a bit longer than two weeks? Depending on
      why your workouts were put on hiatus or how long your break was, the
      same principle applies. You need to ease back into it.
      This is why charting workout programmes is important. I still have my
      very first workout programme stashed somewhere. What worked before can
      certainly work again, but tweaked to your current conditioning.
      If you’re really stuck or lost, there is nothing wrong with seeking out
      a professional.  A qualified personal trainer can certainly help you
      get back on track.
      Be patient. Rushing into things can take the fun out of the journey and
      may also get you injured.
      Most of all, remember why you work out to begin with. Enjoy your time
      with whatever you’re doing.

   [19]Making it work for you

      01/17/2014

      I was recently asked to write about working out on your own vs. taking
      classes, as I am a fan of both.  However, for me it’s a bit more
      complicated than what I’m in the mood for. In deciding how you want to
      get in shape comes down to two simple rules- do what you like and find
      something that works within your schedule.
      There are advantages to both. The main advantage to working out on your
      own is that you can follow your own schedule.  The main advantage to
      taking classes is the variety and guidance.
      However, knowing what works for you is knowing oneself and also trying
      something out. I like to run. Currently, I run outside. Other than the
      brief encounter with a polar vortex, this has been working out rather
      well. I have a good training programme that I follow and running with a
      group would definitely get in the way of that. Plus, running on your
      own is a good to really zone out (while being aware of your
      surroundings, of course).
      Others may prefer the awesome camaraderie that running groups provide.
      They’re a great resource for info, encouragement and a way to meet
      people who have the same goals that you do.
      Picture
      But, when I’m at the gym, I definitely prefer classes.  Working out on
      your own or with a trainer is great, too. If you’re new to working out
      or new at the gym, I highly recommend working out with a personal
      trainer. They’ll give you the basics of what you need to know, plus
      they’ll recommend any programmes the facility has to offer and they can
      introduce you to other staff and gym members.
      As much as I like hanging out at my gym, I felt my workouts were taking
      way too long. If I wasn’t spending time on setting up equipment and
      looking for weights, I was chatting with someone.  Also, I had to
      constantly change my workouts (every three months) to avoid getting
      bored.
      Going to classes let’s me get in all the benefits of a normal workout
      in a condense period of time. You show up ten minutes before class
      starts (there may be minimal equipment set up), chat with other people,
      get your workout in, maybe chat with the instructor after and you’re
      ready to go home.
      During classes, I am focused because this is it. I have no excuses. All
      my equipment is in front of me and no one is there to distract me as
      everyone is focused on their own workout. Plus, you don’t have to worry
      about wearing headphones if you like music and working out with an
      instructor is always fun. Their upbeat personalities make things
      entertaining.
      But whatever you decide to do, if it works out it's a win-win!!

      How do you like to work out? Do you prefer a class or working out on
      your own? Maybe you like a mixture of both?

   [22]What sustains your workout

      01/09/2014

      Picture
      During the recent and brief polar vortex, the thought of running
      outside became so daunting I swallowed my pride and brought the workout
      indoors to the treadmill. For some, the treadmill is regarded as the
      “dreadmill”, but I've done this before I could do it again.
      My runs have gotten a bit longer and I feared monopolizing a treadmill
      for longer than the maximum thirty minutes that my facility allowed.
      However, the gym has been unusually quiet, so I decided to chance it.
      Armed with my best tunes and a great channel on the television, I
      started my workout. I only made it halfway through my run before the
      boredom took over.
      This may be why people hate cardio-especially indoor cardio. It can get
      monotonous. Spin classes and other types of cardio classes are really
      popular because they’re fun.
      But what if you want to get in a long run or a long bike ride? How do
      maintain your sanity past the twenty minute mark?
      How cold does it get before you decide it’s too cold to exercise
      outside? How do you deal with snow and ice?

   [25]Knowing your triggers

      11/04/2013

      Picture
      So, come January I will be celebrating my two-year anniversary of
      working out consistently. It’s had its ups and downs.
      Mostly, it’s been a positive journey.
      One thing working out has helped me to do is watch my diet. I was a
      chronic meal-skipper/late meal-eater. You can’t do that when you’re
      about to go to bootcamp or out for a run. Well, I know I can’t. But,
      I’ll blog about my eating habits for later.
      I’m pretty sure I mentioned that one of the reasons I go to the gym is
      because I can’t work out on my own. I have old videos and weights from
      before, but right now working out on my own is just not in the cards.
      Still, I don’t go as often as I used to and there’s a few reasons for
      that.
      When I first joined, I started going five days a week: four days of
      weights and a mix of cardio, and one day of class - usually mid week
      and usually spin or yoga. Then I changed it up when I got bored or
      someone introduced me to a new class.
      But when I started running outside again, it cut into my gym-going
      immensely.
      Now my gym visits revolve around my runs and consist of the wonderful
      classes that the facility provides. Yes, I can make adjustments, but
      I’m no longer bound to
      I-need-to-do-this-on-this-day-and-workout-exactly-like-this.
      I have running to thank for that.
      In fact, the longer my training runs are the less weight training I can
      do.  And that’s where I am now.
      The winter is almost upon us and I have decided to continue running
      outside. My runs last over 40 minutes (I’m working through an 8k run
      programme) and I would feel bad monopolising a treadmill for that long.
      I’ll probably have to rework my schedule if I have to take running back
      indoors. But I am optimistic I can last the outdoor winter training.
      How often do you change up your routine? What are your triggers? How do
      you come up with a new routine?

   [28]The gym and your contact lenses

      09/24/2013

      [29]0 Comments

      Picture
      Is it safe to workout wearing contact lenses? Of course it is. I wear
      them because I hate wearing my glasses, but my eyesight is so bad that
      not wearing corrective lenses gives me eye strain and headaches.
      Contact lenses aren’t foolproof, though. With the climate controlled
      environment in the gym, the dryness of the air combined with sweat can
      irritate the eyes. This usually only happens during the summer months,
      though, coming into the gym from the outside humidity, and only lasts a
      few minutes.
      Like anywhere else, you have to be diligent about how you care for your
      eyes. I have lost a lens at the gym and it’s no big deal because my
      glasses are always in the car. But what if you’re a contact lens wearer
      and you shower after your workouts, or swim in your lenses?
       Why is this big deal, you ask? Because swimming or showering with your
      contacts in increases your chance of getting an eye infection.
      Picture
      Many people use the showers or pools at the gym. How many of them are
      contact lens wearers? I’d say quite a few. Are they thinking about eye
      infections? Do they have safeguards to prevent this?
      If you do wear your contacts to the gym here are a few things you can
      do to avoid showering in them;
      1.      Shower when you get home.
      2.      Take your case to the gym and take them out before showering
      (for AM pre-work gym rats).
      3.      ALWAYS have an extra pair of contacts or bring your glasses,
      just in case.
      This is probably the only time where I’ll actually say ‘do this’ or
      ‘don’t do this’. I truly don’t want anyone to get an eye infection.

   [31]Keeping me on track

   09/23/2013

   [32]0 Comments

   Picture
   To celebrate a small milestone, I bought the Garmin Forerunner 10. It’s
   really the best thing I ever bought (sorry Blackberry smartphone and
   iPod Nano).  The hardest part about choosing one is which colour to get
   [33]http://static.garmincdn.com/shared/emea/custom/forerunner10/img/wat
   ches.jpg.
   The main reason why I bought the device was for the GPS system and the
   interval functions.  Using my phone’s GPS is very accurate, but you
   can’t always get a signal, it eats up data, it’s heavy and pretty
   sensitive and has a tendency to log out mid workout. The iPod Nano has
   a distance calculator, but it’s pretty inaccurate.
   The Forerunner 10 is as basic as one can get in a GPS exercise watch.
   It has pace function, a calorie counter, a timer and an interval
   function. You can also upload your workouts to your computer. While
   this feature is not necessary at the start of a running programme, it’s
   nice to see your progression once you start running longer intervals.
   For example, as I was working through Todd Lange’s 5k101
   http://runningmatemedia.com/ (also available in iTunes), I noticed how
   much closer I was to hitting that 5k mark.
   Now that I am noticing my fitness improve, I’ve decided to increase my
   mileage. As such, it’s important to keep track of a comfortable run
   pace. You can go by feel, but it’s easy to zone out and next thing you
   know you’re flying through your workout before prematurely hitting the
   figurative wall. Or you can look up a pace using a pace calculator, but
   ultimately, those numbers means nothing if you don’t know the distance
   and that can mean running on a track. BOR-ING! (More on track workouts
   in a future blog).
   Being a base model, the Forerunner 10 does have its limitations. One of
   them being you can’t see all your data on the same screen at one time.
   For example, if I am concerned about pace and distance, I have to
   scroll between screens, which really doesn’t bother me since I’m such a
   slow runner that slowing down for a couple of seconds doesn’t make much
   of a difference to my overall time.
   The second limitation and this is more inconvenient is that the run
   walk interval settings don’t go more than 10 minutes.  This can be
   worked out somehow, just not sure how.
   Overall, I can say that I am happy with the Forerunner 10. I’m sure
   I’ll be able to work through my issues with it. Any suggestions would
   be greatly appreciated.
   Do you rely on gadgets to track your workouts? What are some of your
   favourites?

[38]Is this really a setback?

   04/30/2013

   Picture
   My obsession with running has hit a snag. Don’t get me wrong, I still
   love running, it’s just that I’m injured, or rather, I overtrained. Or
   my shoes might have caused the ‘injury,’ or it was a combination of the
   two.
   But that leaves me in a bind. I had just graduated from Todd Lange’s
   first to 5k programme, and it left me feeling a little invincible. In
   those fleeting moments I had forgotten the most important rule about
   running: work on improving one thing at a time, whether it be
   intensity, speed, or mileage.  You don’t work on all three at the same
   time (not saying I did that - with new shoes to boot).
   So I’m injured. What’s an avid planner supposed to do when she’s
   sidelined? Trek on, of course.
   I can’t work out the way I want to, so it’s back to the drawing board
   and compromise, but injury is not the only hindrance that keeps us from
   our fitness goals. Sometimes life gets in the way - a busy schedule, a
   weekend in Vegas with buffet meals (plus all the fixings).
   These things happen.  It doesn’t mean you’ve failed or fallen off the
   wagon (indulging is not the end of the world) nor must you start from
   scratch when you’ve recovered from injury.
   This is life. Whether the lesson is to enjoy the opportunity or to
   learn from it, your fitness will always be waiting for you when you’re
   ready.

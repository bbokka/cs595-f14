[42]MacroTreatFriday (MTF): Pumpkiney, pumpkin, pumpkin!

   September 19, 2014

   Hi there sweet friends,

   If you read anything related to food, no doubt you've been swarmed
   lately with pumpkin everything. Drinks, treats, soups, casseroles, you
   name it. I can't really say I'm that sad about it. I do love pumpkin in
   cooking and in baking. I use pumpkin year round, but there is something
   extra lovely about it, at this time of year.

   So, without further ado, this Macro Treat Friday post is a Dainty Pig
   round-up of all things to do with pumpkin, that I have posted on the
   blog over the years.

MTF: Dainty Pig Macrobiotic Pumpkin Recipe Round-up

   Get your oven mitts out, crank up the music, and put your apron on :)
   ALL of these treats are vegan, whole-food based and use natural
   ingredients. Most are gluten free friendly, and are in tune with
   Macrobiotic principles.

   every time, and some recipes using all kinds of winter squash in your
   meals.

   Also, I am super happy to announce that I'll be teaching another class
   next week, Friday the 26th, at [52]Templed Mind, on Macrobiotic Sweets
   - finding sweetness within the Macro lifestyle, and how to make some
   tasty treats - great tips for the upcoming holidays. [53]Class info is
   HERE. Hope to see you there!
   What's your favourite PUMPKIN treat?

   Happy day, weekend, baking, life, you name it.
   Sending some love your way.

[67]MTF: Gluten Free Tahini Cookies

   September 5, 2014

   Hi Friends,

   It's Friday...yipee!

   It's been a busy start to the Month, and so today I'm sharing with you
   a repeat (reEAT more like it) recipe for MacroTreat Friday!

MTF: Gluten Free Macrobiotic Tahini Cookies

   [] []

   I made [68]THIS RECIPE that I posted awhile ago...but I used tahini in
   place of the sunflower seed butter. Super yum! Tahini almost tastes
   like peanut butter. Truth.

   To make them gluten free, use gf oat flour. I used all oat flour, and
   no oat flakes this time, and these cookies were way to easy to make
   (mere minutes), and even easier to eat!

   I put a few dark chocolate chips in some, and left some plain.

   They go perfect with a chai tea, and a reading nook in the sun! yum <3

   Happy happy day, friends!

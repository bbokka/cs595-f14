[38]You are Enough

   Posted on [39]October 2, 2014 by [40]Heather Posted in
   [41]Encouragement, [42]Parenting .

   Motherhood is exhausting.

   There are meals to cook and mouths to feed. But before you can cook
   those meals, the kitchen has to be tidy, and the dishes have to be
   done, and you have to decide what to cook, and you have to get to the
   market to get the ingredients.

   You have places to go, and people to see. But before you leave the
   house you have to get yourself dressed, and get the children dressed.
   Which means the laundry must be done, and no, you can’t wear shorts
   when it’s snowing out and did you brush your teeth?

   And don’t forget your own teeth, Mama, or your hair. Ponytail again?
   Maybe a messy bun.

   Lot’s of hugs, and kisses, and Mama, you look pretty and oh my gosh, I
   am so tired!

   Exhausting.

   And that’s just the start of it. If you homeschool, there’s another
   layer of what must be done, and you can’t forget and please, oh please
   don’t let them fall behind. Pressure, expectations, stress. Public
   schoolers aren’t immune…. don’t miss the bus, and that project is due
   Friday, and pack the lunches, and please let the kids be kind to them
   today.

   So what do you do when it’s just. too. much?

   When all you want to do is go back to bed, and the day hasn’t even
   started yet? When you moved and the boxes are still piled against the
   wall, or your pregnant, and you may just be sick again, or the kids
   caught that bug that was going around, and your husband has to work
   late, and there is another deadline looming, and you just can’t.

   Don’t.

   There are days when you just need to stop. Seriously. Right this
   second. Stop.

   Be in the moment.

   [43]You are enough.

   Right now, in this moment, I am sitting here in front of my computer,
   blabbing about who knows what, to all of you. There is plenty else that
   needs done, but right now, in this moment, I am right where I need to
   be, doing right what I need to be doing. In this moment, I am good
   enough. I am doing enough.

   Later, I will sit down with Bug, to go over long division, again. In
   that moment, all I need to be doing is work with him. It’s enough.

   Then, I will make dinner. I’ll stir the pot, and I will put the bread
   in the oven. I’ll be there in the moment, and it just doesn’t matter
   that the laundry needs done, because cooking is enough.

   Tonight, I will lay in bed, and I will try to sleep. And on a day like
   today, that is right where I need to be. I am doing what I need to be
   doing. In that moment, regardless of everything else, laying in bed is
   enough.

   Whatever you are doing right now, you are doing enough too. Forget the
   to-do list. Forget what you think you should be doing. Just focus on
   you, in the moment, right now, and let it be enough.

   Don’t get caught up in the to-do list. Don’t let your expectations get
   out of hand. Don’t push too hard, especially on the hard days. Give
   what you are doing your full attention. Give yourself some grace.

   I promise, you really are enough.

[45]Mother Goose Time: A Day in the Life in our new Homeschool Space

   Posted on [46]September 29, 2014 by [47]Heather Posted in [48]Mother
   Goose Time, [49]Preschool .

   Things are starting to settle down over here. Kind of. I’m waiting on
   extra man power for the last bit of heavy lifting… and I haven’t
   touched any of the boxes the movers put in the garage. But- the main
   parts of the house are coming together very nicely, and it’s looking
   less and less like we are in transition, and more and more like we are
   at home.

   True to my typical fashion, the two most important rooms in the house,
   the kitchen and the homeschool room have received the most attention
   from me. They are ALMOST done, and I am just giddy. The kitchen is now
   open and I am able to get back to making real food instead of frozen
   easy meals… and the homeschool room is liveable for lessons!

   [50]DSC_0522

   The chairs for our school table are still MIA in a box somewhere, and I
   need to get our displays, pocket charts and other goodies set up, but
   the bones of the room are coming together. I think I would like a giant
   world map, and a couple other colorful things to bring it all together,
   but…. it’s open for business!

   I feel like I have said it again and again, but I am ready to get back
   to “normal” life. We do still have quite a bit of adjustment ahead of
   us…. Hubby will be working a new job, with new hours, new travel
   opportunities, and a boatload of new responsibilities. The new baby is
   coming (quickly, it seems!) and we’ll have to get used to that new
   dynamic. Everything is just new… and will be for the time being.

   In the meantime though, it’s just us, doing what we do. Today, I wanted
   to share a day in the life for Little Miss right now- she’s getting
   settled in and getting used to the new routine too! Check out what she
   did with [51]Mother Goose Time today:

   [52]DSC_0475

   She started the day at the little writing desk, and worked on her
   letters. [53]DSC_0486

   I took this opportunity to get some “parent led” work done with Bug,
   and got him set up with his independent work. [54]DSC_0488

   Little Miss got bored of writing before I was finished getting the boys
   going…. [55]DSC_0498

   So she sat and played with some puzzles while she waited on me.
   [56]DSC_0499 I got out my teachers manual and today’s pack.

   [57]DSC_0568

   And we did circle time at the table today, because our corner is still
   a hot mess, and I didn’t get the displays back up yet. No worries,
   circle time at the table is still fun![58] DSC_0500

   (Today‘s materials)[59] DSC_0505

   We looked at today’s poster, and talked about protecting yourself-
   especially bike safety. [60]DSC_0510

   Then we got started on the craft. I just LOVE these rice noodles.
   [61]DSC_0514

   The noodles represent her brain- she built a brain sculpture
   [62]DSC_0530

   And then decorated a “helmet” [63]DSC_0535

   See? It protects the brain!  [64]DSC_0540

   And then I just ignored her ;) [65]DSC_0546

   And she played, and played and played with the brain and helmet. And I
   worked some more with the boys. [66]DSC_0548

   When she was done with that, we talked about how bones protect your
   body too. And we built with blocks to make a protective structure. And,
   knocked it down. [67]DSC_0552

   Which lead her to knocking over the whole toy box. But, that’s okay,
   because it kept her busy for a good long time. [68]DSC_0558

   And I got to help the boys.  [69]DSC_0566

   Who really need me too. And they did a wonderful job.  [70]DSC_0570

   Mr. Man earned a break, so he took a turn playing with Little Miss. The
   buddy system is used here, a LOT! [71]DSC_0572

   So Bug and I tackled factors, and made arrays, and basically melted my
   brain out of my ears, because I am pretty sure I was absent the whole
   time we were taught this in the third grade. Heaven help me!
   [72]DSC_0574

   Little Miss worked on the puzzle that came today, because factors took
   much longer than I had expected…. [73]DSC_0580

          And then over lunch, we talked about what you do if you get hurt
   while playing, and how to get a grown up to help- which wrapped up
   today’s safety lesson with Mother Goose Time!

   And now, it’s time to run out the door to take the kids to gymnastics
   class! Whew!

   this pain aren‚Äôt any ordinary pain
   it slowly tore me apart as the cycle starts again
   it‚Äôs like thousands of bananas
   shove constantly up ur uterus
   and takes over my body
   to make me feel vulnerable
   and sometimes I questioned myself
   why must I undergo this
   because the future seems so bleak
   to lose myself every month
   thousands of knives stabbing into ur stomach and you started to shiver
   vomiting is suddenly a remedy
   to get rid of it
   not long after
   you feel as if you are not alive
   as you turned jelly
   you faint
   and people start caring.
   you questioned

   a short blogging of kbbq and movie ‚Äúafterimages‚Äù with baes üíû We went to
   bugis (bras basah level 2) to have korean bbq to satisfy jiali‚Äôs crave
   and I can totally rant on how limited the variety of meat there was-
   only a total of 5 variety of meat (pork collar meat, bacon, marinated
   chicken, pork belly, beef) and I‚Äôm mostly eating hotdogs throughout the
   bbq which I only find it nice cause im just a sausage lover u can‚Äôt
   imagine how many sausages I can eat in a day. After 15 mins of eating
   the same kind of meat, im already feeling bad and I thought the reviews
   were good but such disappointment psh I will never have kbbq again I
   forgot what is the outlet name though. It‚Äôs mad hot bbqing without
   strong air condition im really glad that there is ice lime juice and
   it‚Äôs perfecttt üçπ we have a impromptu decision to watch a movie since
   it‚Äôs still early and I introduced them to the movie ‚Äúafterimages‚Äù. I
   thought that was a horror movie and it will be pretty exciting but tbh
   the storyline is abit confusing and the sound effects throughout the
   movie is driving me crazy even though it shouldn‚Äôt be that horrifying
   :(((( conjuring was a whole lot better of all the horror I have watched
   but it‚Äôs pretty funny seeing cass closing her eyes while watching and
   jiali keeping her eyes off the screen behind her bag and me holding on
   to the popcorn as a ‚Äòprotection‚Äô :-)))))))) feeling grateful for today
   even though food and movie isn‚Äôt good but it‚Äôs esp good to have gd
   friends in ur life who are able to make ur day by spending time with
   you!!

   Apparently, today is movie time aka interviewing @@ ngee ann city
   tower/marina square. Today was crazy in a sense that I‚Äôm rushing
   throughout the day but it‚Äôs still a good day esp there is good food +
   good movie + good accompany can‚Äôt ask for more!!!! ya with üí∏ flying
   away‚Ä¶..
   Orchard>CityHall>Orchard>Woodlands>Tiong Bahru; can officially declare
   that I have travelled the whole of red line mrt standing today because
   sg mrt is always so freaking packed in the afternoon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

   Anyway I settled for ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù movie after much hesitation and the whole
   movie was great and ya it was exciting because I literally have an eye
   opener to the big screen with the contents of the parts inside the body
   andddd it‚Äôs gross & scary I swear with the sound effects and everything
   but the ending was such a disappointment I thought there‚Äôs more. Can‚Äôt
   imagine ppl that uses more than 40% of their brain omg it‚Äôs crazy I
   didn‚Äôt know how many percent did normal ppl use before watching this
   movie I thought everybody are able to use 100% of their brain but omg I
   was wrong??? It literally depicts the journey of this young lady who
   gets con by her 1week old boyfriend whom she get to know of how dumb
   and got tricked‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and that damn ultra blue crystal like pills (I forgot
   the name of the pills hehe) but it is the bomb I really love how Lucy
   make use of herself and the bloody life threatening pills to help the
   brain professor discover things which he will not be able to find out
   to pass on the knowledge to him of what she saw through using 100% of
   her brain so ultra impressive she sacrifice herself in the end after
   much torture but I think everything is worth it she is such a hero
   though haha ok goodnights I really can‚Äôt describe any movie I have
   watched oops cause the feeling is indescribable

   Just a quick update‚Ä¶ :-))))))

   !!!!!!!!!!!!!Semester 1 is finally over!!!!!!!! (ok I know i‚Äôm late it
   happened 5 days ago) haha and life is great so far without rushing
   through any assignments FOR NOW and projects, visual journals etc. I‚Äôm
   really glad I survived through and most importantly, really thankful
   for all the ultra ‚Äúmatured‚Äù vs childish & fun people that encourage me
   along the way. Couldnt imagine how it‚Äôs like to have poly life without
   them I guess I will just drop out within weeks cause I‚Äôm not a person
   that is suitable for design at all ok everything and every module is
   just telling me that I sucks real lot???? But I think I‚Äôm really not
   coping it well like damn why am I even such a last min person now maybe
   just because I have upgrade to a procrastinator PRO after sec school
   and did I say how much I miss gess??‚Ä¶..

   Anw, life is in a mess and it have been rather more downs than ups and
   idek how am I coping with life these few weeks?? really appreciate for
   each and everyone in my life ok that filled it with every little sense
   of humour and childish-ness *insert emoji* ‚Äî‚Äì I often find myself
   thinking that people nowadays often take things for granted as
   we humans ALWAYS don‚Äôt notice the things others do for them until they
   stop doing it. But come to think of it, I really dont know what people
   are really thinking that got me questioning myself whether am I the one
   whom is expecting too much that have led to further disappointments
   arising.

   As of today, I went to cwp to have a lunch with my bestfriend tgt with
   her aunt and more!! (damn impromptu hehe i‚Äôm invited to celebrate her
   aunt birthday tgt such a honour to have me around I know thx) and
   everything was great in swensens but I feel so sinful to polish off a
   plate of fried food even thou it does not live up to its price at all
   pshh and we have a quick walk around cwp and I went back to my grandma
   house (ok this is a damn short meetup) but i‚Äôm more nervous for tmr‚Äôs
   interview I think it‚Äôs my first formal interview I will be going
   although I‚Äôm just seeking as a part timer but I have to admit I hate
   working and the jobs I have before won‚Äôt even last for two weeks idek
   why am I so unlucky everytime to have the worst job experiences ever I
   swear I won‚Äôt work in f&b again omg but the job I‚Äôm applying for tmr is
   only a 3+weeks event helper ok quite lame but who will even say no to
   money esp u earn it urself???? I sound so long winded but ok good99
   hope ya‚Äôll have a great week ++ gdluck to those who‚Äôs still having
   exams you know u can do it if u just hang in there and endure *inserts
   wink emoji* :-)))))

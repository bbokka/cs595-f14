   this pain arenâ€™t any ordinary pain
   it slowly tore me apart as the cycle starts again
   itâ€™s like thousands of bananas
   shove constantly up ur uterus
   and takes over my body
   to make me feel vulnerable
   and sometimes I questioned myself
   why must I undergo this
   because the future seems so bleak
   to lose myself every month
   thousands of knives stabbing into ur stomach and you started to shiver
   vomiting is suddenly a remedy
   to get rid of it
   not long after
   you feel as if you are not alive
   as you turned jelly
   you faint
   and people start caring.
   you questioned

   a short blogging of kbbq and movie â€œafterimagesâ€ with baes ğŸ’ We went to
   bugis (bras basah level 2) to have korean bbq to satisfy jialiâ€™s crave
   and I can totally rant on how limited the variety of meat there was-
   only a total of 5 variety of meat (pork collar meat, bacon, marinated
   chicken, pork belly, beef) and Iâ€™m mostly eating hotdogs throughout the
   bbq which I only find it nice cause im just a sausage lover u canâ€™t
   imagine how many sausages I can eat in a day. After 15 mins of eating
   the same kind of meat, im already feeling bad and I thought the reviews
   were good but such disappointment psh I will never have kbbq again I
   forgot what is the outlet name though. Itâ€™s mad hot bbqing without
   strong air condition im really glad that there is ice lime juice and
   itâ€™s perfecttt ğŸ¹ we have a impromptu decision to watch a movie since
   itâ€™s still early and I introduced them to the movie â€œafterimagesâ€. I
   thought that was a horror movie and it will be pretty exciting but tbh
   the storyline is abit confusing and the sound effects throughout the
   movie is driving me crazy even though it shouldnâ€™t be that horrifying
   :(((( conjuring was a whole lot better of all the horror I have watched
   but itâ€™s pretty funny seeing cass closing her eyes while watching and
   jiali keeping her eyes off the screen behind her bag and me holding on
   to the popcorn as a â€˜protectionâ€™ :-)))))))) feeling grateful for today
   even though food and movie isnâ€™t good but itâ€™s esp good to have gd
   friends in ur life who are able to make ur day by spending time with
   you!!

   Apparently, today is movie time aka interviewing @@ ngee ann city
   tower/marina square. Today was crazy in a sense that Iâ€™m rushing
   throughout the day but itâ€™s still a good day esp there is good food +
   good movie + good accompany canâ€™t ask for more!!!! ya with ğŸ’¸ flying
   awayâ€¦..
   Orchard>CityHall>Orchard>Woodlands>Tiong Bahru; can officially declare
   that I have travelled the whole of red line mrt standing today because
   sg mrt is always so freaking packed in the afternoonâ€¦â€¦..

   Anyway I settled for â€œLucyâ€ movie after much hesitation and the whole
   movie was great and ya it was exciting because I literally have an eye
   opener to the big screen with the contents of the parts inside the body
   andddd itâ€™s gross & scary I swear with the sound effects and everything
   but the ending was such a disappointment I thought thereâ€™s more. Canâ€™t
   imagine ppl that uses more than 40% of their brain omg itâ€™s crazy I
   didnâ€™t know how many percent did normal ppl use before watching this
   movie I thought everybody are able to use 100% of their brain but omg I
   was wrong??? It literally depicts the journey of this young lady who
   gets con by her 1week old boyfriend whom she get to know of how dumb
   and got trickedâ€¦â€¦ and that damn ultra blue crystal like pills (I forgot
   the name of the pills hehe) but it is the bomb I really love how Lucy
   make use of herself and the bloody life threatening pills to help the
   brain professor discover things which he will not be able to find out
   to pass on the knowledge to him of what she saw through using 100% of
   her brain so ultra impressive she sacrifice herself in the end after
   much torture but I think everything is worth it she is such a hero
   though haha ok goodnights I really canâ€™t describe any movie I have
   watched oops cause the feeling is indescribable

   Just a quick updateâ€¦ :-))))))

   !!!!!!!!!!!!!Semester 1 is finally over!!!!!!!! (ok I know iâ€™m late it
   happened 5 days ago) haha and life is great so far without rushing
   through any assignments FOR NOW and projects, visual journals etc. Iâ€™m
   really glad I survived through and most importantly, really thankful
   for all the ultra â€œmaturedâ€ vs childish & fun people that encourage me
   along the way. Couldnt imagine how itâ€™s like to have poly life without
   them I guess I will just drop out within weeks cause Iâ€™m not a person
   that is suitable for design at all ok everything and every module is
   just telling me that I sucks real lot???? But I think Iâ€™m really not
   coping it well like damn why am I even such a last min person now maybe
   just because I have upgrade to a procrastinator PRO after sec school
   and did I say how much I miss gess??â€¦..

   Anw, life is in a mess and it have been rather more downs than ups and
   idek how am I coping with life these few weeks?? really appreciate for
   each and everyone in my life ok that filled it with every little sense
   of humour and childish-ness *insert emoji* â€”â€“ I often find myself
   thinking that people nowadays often take things for granted as
   we humans ALWAYS donâ€™t notice the things others do for them until they
   stop doing it. But come to think of it, I really dont know what people
   are really thinking that got me questioning myself whether am I the one
   whom is expecting too much that have led to further disappointments
   arising.

   As of today, I went to cwp to have a lunch with my bestfriend tgt with
   her aunt and more!! (damn impromptu hehe iâ€™m invited to celebrate her
   aunt birthday tgt such a honour to have me around I know thx) and
   everything was great in swensens but I feel so sinful to polish off a
   plate of fried food even thou it does not live up to its price at all
   pshh and we have a quick walk around cwp and I went back to my grandma
   house (ok this is a damn short meetup) but iâ€™m more nervous for tmrâ€™s
   interview I think itâ€™s my first formal interview I will be going
   although Iâ€™m just seeking as a part timer but I have to admit I hate
   working and the jobs I have before wonâ€™t even last for two weeks idek
   why am I so unlucky everytime to have the worst job experiences ever I
   swear I wonâ€™t work in f&b again omg but the job Iâ€™m applying for tmr is
   only a 3+weeks event helper ok quite lame but who will even say no to
   money esp u earn it urself???? I sound so long winded but ok good99
   hope yaâ€™ll have a great week ++ gdluck to those whoâ€™s still having
   exams you know u can do it if u just hang in there and endure *inserts
   wink emoji* :-)))))

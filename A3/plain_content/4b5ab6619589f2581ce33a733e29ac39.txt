[3]My Future Husband!

     I'm hoping to inspire and touch people in some way. - August Alsina

   [4][tumblr_na7jt3t8wW1tuszd1o2_250.gif]







   Hey, everyone! Kayla here...again. Sorry I haven't posted in a minute,
    school is driving me crazy. All these projects and all this homework,
    and we just got done with the first week of school. But, that doesn't
   matter right now. I came to express my love for this wonderful man that
        I love so dearly, yet he doesn't know I exist, and that is my
                 business!! But, he will one day. Trust me!



   If you know me personally, or know of me, you will know that I am a die
    hard fan for August Alsina, and I have been for quite some time. Most
     people (girls), from where I live now, only like him because of the
   handsome looks God took his time to bless him with, but I will tell you
           the real reason I love August...this may take a minute.



    Well, I just remember one morning, I was getting ready for school. I
    was in my room getting dressed, and MTV Jams was on my tv (I watch it
    almost every morning before school). This horrible Fabolous song had
    just went off, and I was thinking about turning it off and playing my
     own music, but something told me not too. Thank God I didn't! All I
     heard was this guy kept chanting the words, I love it. The beat was
      really catchy, and the guy was oh so sexy! I just could not stop
                             staring at the tv.



    When the song finally went off, I caught his name flashing across the
    tv. It said, August Alsina. To tell the truth, I questioned the name.
     August Alsina? I thought it was a joke, to be honest. But, I rocked
    with the song. His voice was nice, but I needed to hear more before I
                             really judged him.



     With that said, when I got to school, I looked him up. I read about
    him, and learned some things that really stood out to me - like, the
     fact that his brother was killed, and how he was homeless. I really
    began to have sympathy for August, and my love for him grew fast and
   deep. It's not everyday we find a new R&B artist, or even a rap artist,
   who shares their struggle so that listeners can relate. All these days,
   we have artists telling us what they have, and it's really like a slap
     in the face, because not all of us can say we have fancy cars, huge
    houses, and jewelry and clothes to die for. Instead, August tells us
      where he came from, how he grew up, hard life experiences he went
    through, and at just 16 years old, I can relate to him - in more ways
                                  than one.



     Besides the good looks (which are a plus to me loving him), August
     speaks the truth. One thing he always says in interviews is, no one
    will ever rob me of my honesty, and I respect that 100%. But, that's
   also a reason why some people see him as a threat. August keeps it real
   24/7, and some people confuse it with him being angry and mean - that's
    not the case. If you feel that way, then maybe he's just too real for
     you to handle, and you should find someone else who fits your real
                                description.



       I tell you, the minute I got home, I hopped on my computer and
   downloaded EVERYTHING he made. Mixtapes and all, and I just really sat
   there and listened to his music. I shed a few tears here and there, and
     now each song he's made has a little part of me. I've watched every
   interview, and I just vibe with him. He gives off a spirit that I love,
                 and for that, I'll always be a fan of him.



    If you're not into August Alsina, just take the time to listen to his
     music before you judge. I feel like we should all do that will all
     music artists. You never know, you might just find someone who you
   really dig. I will say, his attitude can be....hard, at times, but he's
   a cool guy. I really hope I get the chance to meet him one day and just
       share how his music has helped me with my own life experiences.

[16]Well, Hello!

   This is actually my first post, so I just thought I'd start off by
   introducing myself and tell you why I'm here.
   My name is Kayla, but my family and close friends call me Kay. Simple.
   I'm 16 years old, and I'm just living life. My dream is to become a
   Television and Radio Talk Show Host, an actress, and an entrepreneur. A
   lot, right? Well, it is, truth be told, but I'm striving to make all of
   those things come true. During my free time, I love to write on my
   Wattpad site (you should definitely check out my work), listen to
   music, and enjoy time with the people I love most. Now, I'm getting
   into the blogging thing. I'm a very simple person; I don't ask for
   much, but I'm very unique.
   I believe I'm very different than most teens around my age group - I'm
   not seen at parties every weekend, I've never smoked weed, and I'm a
   virgin. I believe life has more to offer than just throwing it away
   every chance you get. There's so much more than just the simple things,
   and I want to be successful. Being out in the streets will not get me
   there, so I try to stay away as far as I can. I wish every teen could
   have the same mindset as myself, but, unfortunately, they can't.
   On this blog, I'll be talking about everything that comes to mind -
   personal issues, everyday life, and just things I feel like getting off
   my chest or anything that comes to mind. Feel free to share your
   thoughts with me, I'd love to hear them. Also, please keep everything
   negative away from this blog. I don't affiliate myself with that, and
   I'd appreciate if you keep the negative comments away. I hear enough
   unwanted comments in my life already, I'd hate to come here and have to
   deal with it. You don't have to be here.
   I'll try and post when I can. I just downloaded the app, so expect to
   hear A LOT from me. I talk too much (so I've been told), and I type
   even more!
   Love, Always!

                                  Kayla :)

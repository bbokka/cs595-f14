TOFU MOM . . . and gravy!

   The incoherent ramblings of a Fairly Odd TOFU MOM. (aka
   "Tofu-and-Sprouts"). Unapologetically delicious, vegan comfort food
   (and lots of GRAVY!); My 'Sprouts' are mostly grown, but happily raised
   on these kid-tested, Mom-approved, easy, budget-friendly recipes from
   my kitchen.

          Seattle-Tacoma-ish, Washington
          ~~~QUITE SIMPLY, I'M VEGAN AND LOVE TO COOK! ~~~ Over the years,
          I've collected tons of "Favorite Family Recipes" that I'm
          gradually veganizing. Friends and family are ALWAYS asking for
          recipes, so I decided to post them here. ~~~~ If I get an idea
          from a cookbook, I'll be sure and note it, but most ideas are
          recipes I've modified 'till they don't resemble the original, or
          I got from family members, or came up with thru trial and error.
          ~~~~ That said: I'm first-and-foremost a MOM to three wonderful
          Veggie Kids who are my life, my passion, my WORLD! ~~~~ I'm in
          that "over-forty" crowd (though you know what they say about us
          "older women"!)and lovin' it - I wouldn't trade this age for any
          other. ~~~ Of course, I'm vegan and passionate about my
          lifestyle, sharing recipes and ideas, and showing people all the
          tasty goodies that we Vegans eat! ~~~ What else...Oh, I'm also a
          Special Education Teacher working in a program with Autistic
          Kindergarteners. ~~~ My life is full and challenging, exhausting
          and exhilerating. Most days I love it. Other days I come home
          and turn into a couch potato and snuggle with my girls.

[50]Blue-Corn Waffles (Using "The Vegg Baking Mix") and Berry Sauce

   Spending several vacations in New Mexico has given me real appreciation
   for the traditional flavors of the region. I'll spare you a complete
   recap, as I've previously drooled and blogged at length about my love
   affair with all foods dusty, earthy and spicy - tamales, green chiles,
   piñon, posole.

                      Blue-Corn Waffle with Berry Sauce

   But one of my favorite New Mexico items was blue corn. Dried and ground
   into cornmeal, it really doesn't taste or cook up any differently than
   regular corn meal, but I do love the blue-lavender tinge it gives to
   baked goods. I found an unopened bag of blue-corn flour deep in my
   cupboard this weekend, and used it in my standard cornmeal-and-pecan
   waffle recipe. While these didn't cook up as brown as regular waffles,
   (in fact the blue flecks make them look a tad on the anaemic side),
   they were splendidly DELICIOUS!!
   [51][1ab.jpg]
   Vegans eat animals for
   breakfast too! (Regular
   waffles, not blue-corn.)
   The people who make the vegan "egg" product called The Vegg, recently
   sent me a sample of their new [52]Vegg Baking Mix product to try and I
   used it here as well, rather than my typical flax-egg goo. I was
   impressed with the lightness it seemed to give the waffles and how easy
   it was to use in my recipe. While I hadn't really found much practical
   use for the original "The Vegg" product, I do think this Baking Vegg
   will be a nice addition to the list of "egg-substitutes" for those who
   make baked goods, pancakes, waffles and that sort of thing.
   If blue-corn isn't your thing, I have [53]dozens of recipes for
   waffles, just do a search here on my blog. They've always been a
   weekend standard, and in our house, and they are [54]ALWAYS topped with
   fruit sauce. (Well, ha! ...almost always!)
   When my kids were very little they would call my fruit sauce "gravy"
   (because it seems everything I make involves gravy in some form or
   another, they always assumed fruit sauce was "gravy" too!)
   New Mexico Inspired Blue Corn Waffles
     * 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (pastry flour preferred)
     * 1 Tbsp. cornstarch
     * 1/2 cup finely ground cornmeal
     * 2 tbsp. finely chopped or ground pecans, piñons or any nuts of your
       choice
     * 1 teaspoon salt
     * 2 teaspoons baking powder
     * 1 tsp Vegg Baking Mix with 1/4 cup of water (OR flax-egg-mixture to
       equal one egg)
     * 3/4 cup soy milk (may need more)
     * 1 tablespoon canola oil

   Preheat waffle iron. We have one of those Belgian Waffle makers that
   produces extra thick waffles, (we also have one that makes farm-animal
   shaped waffles) but any kind works...
   Mix dry ingredients into a bowl (or batter bowl with pouring spout).
   Add Vegg mixture, soy milk and oil and stir gently until well mixed. If
   batter is not a good ladling/pouring consistency, add a little water or
   soy milk. Pour into waffle maker, and bake until golden and crisp.
   Serve immediately with maple syrup or fruit sauce.
   .
   Fresh Raspberry (or ANY Berry) Sauce
     * 3 cups fresh raspberries (or other berry of choice), or 3
       (10-ounce) packages frozen raspberries, thawed, make SURE to keep
       whatever juices are in the thawed berries.
     * 2 Tablespoons sugar
     * 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
     * 4 tsp. cornstarch
     * 1/4 cup water, orange juice, pomegranite juice, red wine, whatever.
       (I use water or OJ for my kids)

   1. Purée berries, and any berry juice in blender or food processor
   fitted with metal blade. Blend until berries are well crushed, but
   don't over blend or you'll blend the seeds into fine grit. Continue to
   step two if not straining out the seeds:
   --- If you want seedless sauce, press purée into small bowl through
   mesh sieve with back of spoon to remove seeds. Yes, this is time
   consuming and feels a bit wasteful. But when the kids all had braces...
   hey...  Add water to make 2 1/2 cups. (I pour the water through the
   strainer to get any last bits of pulp).
   2. If not straining the fruit, continue here:
   Stir in sugar and lemon juice to taste. Stir until sugar dissolves.
   Dilute with reserved juice, if desired.
   3. Mix cornstarch with 1/4 cup water, red wine or orange juice.
   Heat berry puree to a boil, watching carefully and stirring as needed,
   once it boils, it will boil over VERY fast. As soon as it boils, add
   cornstarch mixture and lower heat to med-high. Whisk until it comes
   back to a boil, thickens, and is not cloudy - should take just a
   minute.
   4. Remove from heat, cool a bit (if you can stand it) serve over
   waffles, cake, ice cream, pancakes, biscuits, shortcake, anything.
   See? It's a lot like GRAVY, isn't it?

[58]MORE "Things to do with gravy..."

   Crispy Fried Tofu and Pan Gravy
   This is the simplest supper I can imagine; super-quick, I always have
   the ingredients on hand, my family loves it, and it involves GRAVY...
   Here's how you do it:
     * Thinly slice well-drained, extra firm tofu.
     * Gently toss with *seasoned cornstarch so you have it coated in a
       light layer.
       (*That's just cornstarch mixed with a good dose of whatever you
       like - we used lemon pepper, cayenne, sage and a little salt).
     * Pan fry (yes... FRY!) in a non-stick pan over medium heat (use a
       thin puddle of peanut or coconut oil), until crispy and
       lightly browned, turning as needed.
     * Keep tofu cubes/slices/triangles warm in a low oven.
     * Wipe out skillet to remove most of the excess oil and crumbs.

   Make gravy:
     * Melt 2 Tbsp. margarine in the same skillet.
     * Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. flour over margarine, cook and stir over medium
       heat until tan-brown.
     * Turn heat OFF and gradually stir in 1 cup soymilk.
     * Season with 2 tsp Marmite or Vegemite (or you can use a brown
       veggie bouillon powder) 1/2 tsp. sage and 1/4 tsp. freshly ground
       black pepper.
     * Stir (a wire whisk is best) until all browned flour is well
       incorporated.
     * Whisk in 1/2 cup water.
     * Turn heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until the
       gravy thickens, about 7 minutes.
     * If it boils too hard, turn heat down a little.
     * Taste, and season with salt and pepper.

   Drizzle (or better yet, POUR) gravy over tofu. Enjoy.

[62]Magic Vegan Bacon Gravy!

   As some of you may know, if you're still following along, this month is
   known to vegan bloggers everywhere as "[64]Vegan MoFo" or Vegan Month
   of Food Blogging. Hundreds of bloggers from [65]all over the world are
   posting their recipes, ideas and reviews. There are "[66]Iron Chef"
   contests, Instagram photos, recaps and fun giveaways. While I'm mainly
   signed up to give myself the needed inspiration to blog more regularly,
   I DO like reading what other bloggers are cooking up. And sometimes I
   even enter the contests..

   What, WHAT?
   I was surprised and a little amused last week when I was notified that
   I'd actually WON one of the Vegan MoFo contests. For a product I'd only
   recently heard about, and wasn't terribly interested in, called...
   (don't laugh) "[68]Magic Vegan Bacon Grease". Yes. Seriously.
   Let me explain.
   I grew up in a vegetarian home.
   I've always cooked vegan or vegetarian. I don't think I've ever even
   SEEN someone cook bacon in real life!
   The very words "Bacon" and "Grease" horrified me a little (I'm not
   exactly sure why, when I am perfectly happy embracing every other
   faux-meat product on the market). I guess I really wasn't sure what one
   DID with ....bacon grease? I thought the idea was to drain all that
   meat-fat-stuff OUT of the pan? But what do I know?
   Well, according to my blogger-friend [69]Bianca, whom I trust for all
   things Vegan and Southern, "Down South, people save their bacon grease.
   And they cook with it over and over and over." Seriously? Alrighty
   then...
   So, what to do with this mysterious jar of VEGAN bacon grease? It
   occurred to me: Google what people did with the REAL stuff....
   Oh. ...duh. Gravy.
   (And after reading reviews, apparently way more than gravy - the stuff
   IS magic! Drooling vegans everywhere are making vegan bacon popcorn,
   vegan bacon dressing, southern greens, home fried bacon-potatoes, etc.)
   Well OF COURSE! That makes perfect sense now, and with my love of all
   things American-Southern, I have NO idea why this was such a foreign
   idea to me.

   MAGIC VEGAN BACON GRAVY!!
   So I immediately went to work making gravy. Maybe I should have tried a
   more traditional cream-style bacon-y breakfast gravy to go with grits
   or biscuits, but it was dinner time and my family was craving mashed
   potatoes and "[71]nut loaf", so that's where the bacon gravy ended up.
   And it was amazing!!I might never make gravy any other way again!
   Made from coconut oil, soy protein, spices, hickory and maple flavors,
   you don't need a lot, but it adds a great flavor to gravy or whatever
   you decide to use it on.
   As you can almost see in the picture, I also sauteed some onions and
   Hungarian sweet peppers in the bacony magic. Also epic, and worth
   repeating over and over. I admit I was a skeptic, but now I'm SUPER
   excited by this new addition to my vegan arsenal.
   If you'd like to try this deliciousness, and if, like me, you live in a
   vegan wasteland where new products never manage to make it within 75
   miles, let me assure you, you can order this online. That's what I'll
   be doing. Soon!
   This is a nice, basic, brown gravy. I didn't want the bacon flavor to
   overpower the other parts of the meal, and it didn't, a perfect balance
   of with a bit of bacon-sweet-salty-smokiness, it will go GREAT with
   your dinner-time loaves, burgers, roasts, etc.
   Magic Vegan Bacon Gravy
     * 2 Tbsp. Magic Vegan Bacon Grease
     * 1 medium onion, minced
     * 4 Tbsp. flour
     * 2 cups water
     * 1 tsp soy sauce
     * 2 Tbsp strong coffee (made from instant or the dregs left in the
       pot are fine)
     * 1 tsp white or red wine vinegar
     * 1 cup unsweetened plant milk
     * salt, pepper, sage to taste

   Melt Magic Vegan Bacon Grease in cast-iron skillet over low-medium
   heat. Add minced onion, increase heat to medium or medium-high.
   Watch carefully and stir with whisk to keep from sticking, cook until
   onion starts to brown and is translucent.
   [72][983799_10152762327063103_6957277743069041600_n.jpg]
   Serve over everything!
   Lower heat to medium, add flour and stir for several minutes until
   flour-onion-oil mixture starts to turn light tan.
   Add water gradually, stirring to keep things smooth. Turn heat back to
   medium-high and add soy sauce, coffee and vinegar. Let gravy come to a
   boil and turn down to barely a simmer.
   Add plant milk and slowly simmer for 5 minutes until thick. Add water
   if needed. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a pinch of sage if
   desired.
   Serve over anything!

[76]Cashew Gravy

   [77][011gravy%2BCH.jpg]
   Boring picture. Yummy gravy.
   Another classically cliche, vegan recipe that everyone should add to
   their repertoire is CASHEW GRAVY!
   We vegans love our cashews and the creaminess they impart to sauces and
   such (unless you're like my friend Molly - she's a fabulous vegan cook,
   but has never made cashew-based gravy or sauce because every time she
   buys cashews she ends up eating them all raw before she ever gets
   around to cooking with them! Not that I blame her, I LOVE cashews! It's
   fine. When Molly wants gravy, she knows where to come for dinner.)
   Molly, you really need to try this recipe though; in fact, everyone
   does.
   It's super simple, full of creamy, vegan, earthy, cashew goodness and
   (IF you manage to stay out of the cashews) you probably have all the
   ingredients in your cupboard right now!
   TIP 1.)    Don't skip this recipe if you've forgotten to soak your
   cashews!
   Here’s a trick I learned from [78]Isa Moskowitz: planning ahead to soak
   the nuts is a great idea, but how many of us are really organised
   enough to do that? You CAN make cashew recipes happen at the last
   minute. If you’re okay with the radiation (I am), put the nuts in a
   glass dish, covered with water and microwave for three minutes, then
   drain -  and you've saved yourself hours of prep time!
   [79][000111.jpg]
   Gravy in pan. Boring.
   TIP 2.)   The best thing about this gravy? I LOVE using it to replace
   those gloppy, not-vegan, canned "Cream-of-Whatever" soups in all your
   favorite 1960's-era casserole recipes. The texture is perfect!
   Creamy Cashew Gravy
     * 1 1/2 cups very hot water  (super-hot tap water, but not boiling,
       it'll help cashews blend smoother)
     * 1 1/2 cups UNsweetened plant milk (I like rice milk here, the gravy
       is plenty creamy with the cashews)
     * 1/3 cup raw cashews (soaked 1/2 hour OR overnight if you
       remembered, or see tip above)
     * 1/4 cup rolled oats (quick or slow cooking but NOT the "steel-cut"
       ones)
     * 3 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce or 1 Tbsp. Marmite/Vegemite
     * 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
     * 1 1/2 tsp. onion powder
     * 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
     * 1 pinch powdered sage
     * 1/8 tsp. salt or to taste

   [80][0010432462_10152082813347504_4015517199841333005_n.jpg]
   NOT boring!
   My fabulous friend,
    Molly, who WILL
   eventually stop eating
    all the cashews ahead
    of time, and attempt
   cashew gravy! HAHA!
   1. Put all the ingredients EXCEPT plant milk, in your blender or food
   processor. Blend until smooth (add a few more Tablespoons water if it's
   too thick to blend) - this could take several minutes depending on your
   blender. I have a cheap food processor, (NOT some fancy
   Vita-Bullet-Super-Power-Blend-It-All). It takes me about four minutes
   of blending, but the end results are still smooth and creamy. Pour
   mixture into a pan or medium cast-iron skillet.
   2. Put the plant milk in the blender/processor. Blend again to make
   sure you got all the cashew mixture. Add this to the pan.
   3. Warm over medium-low heat, simmering gently and whisking often (but
   not constantly as you do with other gravies).
   Cook for about 5 - 7 minutes until it gets thick.
   If it gets too thick, add a little water or plant milk. (I usually have
   to add another 1/2 cup water or so.)
   Season with salt and pepper to taste.

[84]Vegan Meatballs and Mushroom Gravy

   We all need ANOTHER recipe for vegan meatballs, right?
   So cliche, I know.
   And yet, they're the PERFECT vehicle for gravy, any type of gravy or
   sauce really, so I had to include them in this months' list of posts.
   [85][11GRAVY%2BBRY.jpg] This is my go-to meatless meatball recipe
   because it doesn't have a long list of ingredients - plus you get a
   MUSHROOM GRAVY recipe as bonus!
   If you have another meatball recipe you prefer, then use that one, but
   by all means, try meatballs smothered in GRAVY! (Or BBQ sauce, or
   sweet-and-sour sauce, or glaze, or alfredo sauce or gravy, or gravy
   or...).
   Non-Meatballs with Mushroom Gravy
   Meatballs
   1 cup firm tofu, mashed very fine (not the silken variety found in
   vacuum-packed cartons)
   ½ cup wheat germ
   ¼ cup parsley, chopped
   2 Tbsp. plant milk
   2 Tbsp. nutritional yeast
   ½ Tbsp. onion powder
   ½ tbsp. garlic powder
   1 tsp. salt
   ¼ tsp. black pepper
   ¼ tsp. each - oregano, garlic powder and sage
   1 Tbsp. olive oil
   1 Tbsp. soy sauce
   gluten flour (optional only if needed)
   Preheat oven to 350°F.
   Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl.
   Let mixture set for about 15 minutes for flavors to blend. Adjust
   texture if needed. (If ingredients are too wet or dry and don't stick
   together, add some gluten flour or more plant milk as needed.)
   Roll into walnut-size balls or slightly smaller.
   Place on a greased cookie sheet. Spray oil over the top of the balls
   for a more crispy texture. Bake for 30 minutes until browned. Serve
   warm.
   Gravy
   2 Tbsp margarine
   1/3 cup sliced mushrooms
   3 cloves garlic, crushed
   ¼ cup onions, chopped
   2/3 cup flour
   ½ tsp. ground sage
   2 Tbsp. nutritional yeast
   4 Tbsp. soy sauce
   2 ½ cups water
   ¼ cup dry red wine
   salt and pepper to taste
   Melt margarine in a medium saucepan and sauté mushrooms, onions and
   garlic. When onions are tender and translucent, and mushrooms have
   released liquid.
   Stir in the flour, nutritional yeast and sage to form a paste. Slowly
   add water, soy sauce and wine, stirring constantly. Let simmer for 5
   minutes, stirring so it doesn't stick - if too thick add water.
   Pour over "meatballs" and heat in a casserole dish and serve.

[89]Miso-Mushroom Gravy

   So, it's time for another actual GRAVY recipe.
   Today's recipe, a beautiful, brown Miso-Mushroom Gravy, happens to be
   one of my favorite gravy recipes (because it has miso and mushrooms in
   it, duh) and one of my favorite gravies to go over brown rice. (ALL
   gravy is my favorite for something, in case you haven't figured that
   out by now...).
   [90][01gravy1%2B(1).jpg] Not sure when I decided that this particular
   gravy and rice combo was the way it "should" be, but ... well... it
   just is.
   I've made this as a fast, easy supper for years ("easy" with the help
   of a rice-cooker) and even if ONE of my un-named children might pick
   the mushrooms out, it's still a family favorite - comfort food with a
   slightly "Asian" twist.
   Sometimes I get all crazy and add fried tofu cubes and/or stir-fried
   veggies and turn it into an Asian-stir-fry-gravy mess. That's amazingly
   delicious too!!
   Note: They say that boiling miso destroys the beneficial properties, so
   I always add it at the end. If you've never used miso before, this is a
   great way to get acquainted with it's salty, nutty, umami flavor.
   Mushroom and Miso Gravy
     * 1 tsp. any regular oil
     * 1 tsp. dark sesame oil
     * 2 cups thinly sliced small mushrooms (I like shiitake or morels
       here if I can get them, but regular button mushrooms work well too)
     * 1 cup vegetable broth, (I actually use a "beef" style vegan broth
       here, I like the stronger taste and rich brown color in this gravy,
       you can just use regular vegetable broth or dilute half with water
       if you prefer it milder and less salty)
     * 1 cup water
     * 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, finely grated
     * 1 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch
     * 2 Tablespoons white miso (or any variety) mixed with 1/4 cup warm
       water
     * fresh ground pepper

   Saute mushrooms in oil in cast iron skillet until juices come out and
   mushrooms start to brown.
   Add broth, water and ginger. Bring to rapid simmer, then cover and
   simmer gently for 5 to 7 minutes.
   In a small container, combine cornstarch with just enough water to
   dissolve. Whisk it into the pan, bring to a boil, and cook just until
   the gravy thickens.
   Remove from heat.
   Combine miso with 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl and whisk until
   smooth. Stir miso into the gravy.
   Season with pepper to taste.

[94]Vegan Chicken N' Noodle Casserole

   [95][1chx.jpg] Today's recipe is "first-day-of-Autumn", rainy-day
   comfort food, pure and simple. It's my vegan version of an old,
   back-of-the-box classic; one of those 1960's-TV-dinner-era casseroles
   that everyone makes fun of, but we all secretly loved for their creamy,
   slurpy-noodle-filled, cozy goodness.
   If you're wondering where the "gravy" is (since this IS still "Vegan
   Month of Gravy" and all) this dish is fondly known as "Chicken Gravy
   And Noodles" among the silver-haired church-potluck crowd of the
   American South. This is an easy recipe to throw together with items
   from your pantry and freezer, and leftovers (what?) reheat great the
   next day!
   Happy first day of Fall (here in the United States anyway). Curl up on
   the couch in front of the fire, listen to the rain outside and enjoy a
   big, warm bowl of yum!
   Chicken N' Noodle Casserole
     * 4 tablespoons margarine
     * salt
     * 12 - 14 ounces any type of noodle (I use broken spaghetti noodles)
     * 10 ounces small white mushrooms, quartered
     * 1 med-to-large onion, chopped or 1 leek, sliced
     * 2 stalks of celery, sliced thin
     * 1 large carrot, chopped
     * Freshly ground pepper
     * 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
     * 1/2 tsp dried dill
     * 1 tsp. onion powder
     * 1/2 cup white wine (or just use water)
     * 4 cups vegetarian chicken-flavor broth OR vegetable broth plus 1
       cup water
     * 1 cup plant milk
     * 1 cup frozen petite peas
     * 1 cup finely chopped zucchini, green beans, corn or any mixed
       veggies you want, fresh or frozen
     * 2 cups chopped vegan chicken product (I used '[96]Beyond
       Meat[97]®") or cubed, firm tofu
     * 2 Tablespoons chopped parsley
     * 2 tsp. lemon juice
     * crushed crackers or bread crumbs if desired for topping

   Preheat the oven to 375° F.
   Lightly grease a 3-quart casserole dish.
   Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste.
   Cook noodles until al dente, about 4 minutes.
   Drain noodles, set aside.
   Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the margarine in large pot over
   medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, celery, onion, carrots and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent.
   [98][12chx.jpg] Melt remaining margarine into pot of vegetables.
   Sprinkle in flour, dill, onion powder, a few grinds of pepper and a
   sprinkle of salt. Whisk flour around with vegetables for a minute or
   two and then add wine. Continue to whisk, and add the broth-water
   mixture and plant milk, stirring with whisk the entire time.
   Raise heat a bit. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat and
   simmer for 10 minutes.
   Fold in the peas, zucchini, noodles, mushrooms, vegetarian chicken,
   parsley and lemon juice.
   Taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the buttered
   casserole dish and top with crushed crackers or breadcrumbs if desired.
   Bake for 30 - 40 minutes until bubbly, and topping (if used) is browned
   a bit.
   Enjoy!

[4]Ebola in the US

   [5][Ebola.jpg]
   Ebola has hit the US.   When you don't limit travel from the hot zone
   and you have a WIDE open boarder (northern and southern), this is what
   you can expect.    If you trust the US government to keep you safe, you
   are more trusting than me.   This is considering they can't even keep
   the President safe in his own mansion.
   Here are some links to help you out on the topic.  This isn't meant to
   cause panic, but rather inform you.
   CNN on 1st Ebola case in the country.

   The Hospital screwed up on dealing with an African who recently flew to
   this county with influenza symptoms.

[21]Going Back to War Again!!!!

   As September 11^th is tomorrow, and after hearing the President speak
   tonight and members of congress speak the last couple of days something
   has become increasingly clear to me.  In thirteen years we have learned
   nothing.   We are ready to ramp up the war machine again without clear
   direction nor with the commitment to do what needs to be done.
   War is a very ugly business.   Loss of life will occur, and some of
   that will be of the innocent.  Our young men and women will give their
   lives in the name of freedom.   We keep doing this over and over again
   and get the same pathetic results (Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and
   Iraq).  This is because we as a nation do not have the stomach to fight
   a war with the means necessary to win it.   President Bush and now
   President Obama are making the same mistake.  This mistake is not
   fighting a war to win it.
   We won the WWII because we understood the barbarism of our enemy.   We
   were willing to do all that was necessary to devastate and destroy or
   them.   We killed thousands of innocent women, men, and children while
   defeating our enemy.   We dropped the most devastating weapon known to
   man to end the war with victory.   We had leaders who understood our
   enemy and what it would take to defeat them.   I say this not with glee
   or a blood lust, but rather with a clear understanding that if we do
   not win wars and completely destroy our enemy, we have to repeat the
   wars.   There is not a “surgical solution” for war.   If we believe we
   have the moral authority to enter into war, we better damn well be
   willing to do what is necessary to win.   If we don’t, we spit on those
   whose lives were lost.
   We also have made the mistake that if we give these people “freedom”
   they would be our friend and we would have planted the seed of
   democracy in the Middle East.   Like the fools in Washington, I
   believed that crap too.   The one thing that we either didn’t recognize
   or refused to believe is that we cannot take a people who have lived
   under a despot for thousands of years and automatically expect them to
   be able to live free.   For a people to be able to support freedom,
   they have to of experienced some self rule.   The colonist of our
   nation had common law and had some form of freedom which gave them the
   structure for self rule.   They developed the taste of freedom and
   wanted ultimate and complete self determination.   Without this
   experience, we would have fallen under complete anarchy if we attempted
   the great experience of freedom.   To expect a people whose standard of
   living hasn’t seen a significant improvement for thousands of years,
   and who have never had any sort of self determination to automatically
   be able to self rule was foolish.   I remember Colin Powell stating
   that if we broke it (Iraq), we bought it.  He knew that Saddam Hussein;
   while a dictator, gave stability and structure.   With the vacuum of
   leadership we left when we ousted him, we gave way to the rise of
   ISIS.   We questioned why President Bush 41 didn’t take Bagdad in the
   1990’s.  I believe he understood that what we are experiencing now
   would have occurred.
   We are going take this folly on again, and unless we are truly willing
   to do ALL that is necessary to defeat ISIS; no matter the cost, we
   should come home and leave the Middle East to take care of
   themselves.   Let us protect our boarder, have true immigration reform
   (so we know who is in this country), and become completely energy
   independent, so that we are not willing to entangle ourselves in the
   issues of others again.    If we as a people (both Republicans and
   Democrats) are not willing to take a Jeffersonian approach to our place
   in the world, we will continue to be at war.  Our biggest influence on
   the world should not be because of our military might, but because of
   the example we set.

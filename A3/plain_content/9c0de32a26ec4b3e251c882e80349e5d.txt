[3]Short Rib Pastrami At Whole Foods: House-Smoked Beef & Turkey Lured Me To
Sandwiches

                         [4][photo%2B1%2B(27).JPG]
                      Short rib pastrami at Whole Foods

   I'm still looking for the hidden gems at Whole Foods, and I'm trying to
   work the edge of store -- produce, cheeses, fish, and the like.
   Generally, I'm not big on sandwiches, but the deli has me packing lunch
   with meats that they smoke and slice in house.  Smoked turkey is moist
   and full of flavor, and it's even better paired half-and-half with
   short rib pastrami.
   [5][photo%2B2%2B(27).JPG]
   I'd never heard of that before.  Look in the deli case.  The have
   pieces of smoked short rib.  Presumably, they brine and smoke the cut
   in the way that brisket or beef round becomes your normal pastrami.
   The smoke amazes me.  A sandwich of smoked turkey and short rib
   pastrami tastes nothing like your generic sandwich.  The short rib is
   fatty.  I'm surprised how much I enjoy the meat because I normally ask
   for lean corned beef or pastrami.  But it's a dry texture, and the
   richness pairs nicely with turkey slices.  They both have that smokey
   flavor and a slightly crunchy edge.  Less than a quarter pound of meat
   has a "big sandwich" flavor.
   What else have people discovered at the Whole Foods?  The
   fresh-squeezed orange juice is criminally expensive, but it's
   spectacularly delicious.  I enjoyed some fresh ravioli, and I'm very
   happy with all the fruit and vegetables that I've bought.

[16]Hangari Noodle Company Bringing Hand-Cut Noodles To Catonsville As Early
As This Weekend

                          [17][Hangari%2Bchef.jpg]
             Hangari Noodle Company chef rolling out the noodles

   Back with more news about Hangari Noodle Company, the new restaurant
   bringing hand-pulled noodles to Catonsville from Los Angeles and
   opening as early as this weekend
   Lisbeth of the [18]Lisbeth Eats blog had sent me [19]a report that I
   posted last month.  Now, she is back with the name -- Hangari Noodle
   Company -- and some details about the house-made noodles at the center
   of the new place.  This will open in Hanoori Town, the cluster of
   restaurants a few doors down from the H Mart in Catonsville.
   Lisbeth reports that the owner/chef has been in the restaurant business
   for more than 20 years in LA.  The new Hangari Noodle follows the
   concept of his current LA restaurant -- focusing on two types of
   noodles and serving them in a variety of broths and sauces.  This
   sounds like a cool addition to the Rte 40 corridor -- noodles that are
   rolled, cut and boiled only after you order.
   As I hear (not from Lisbeth), the soft opening will be Friday.  So
   watch for a full opening as early as this weekend.
   Please don't hold me to consistent Korean spelling.  Transliteration of
   Korean words can lead to multiple spellings.  Lisbeth and I use
   different versions at different times.  Just check out what she says:

     The owner/chef owned and operated Curry Hyang in Korea Town in LA, a
     popular Japanese restaurant specializing in curry and Japanese style
     noodles. After many years there, he sold the business and went on to
     open a kalgooksoo restaurant, with a business partner, in Korea Town
     called “Hangari Kalgooksoo.”

     This talented chef used the training he acquired in Korea under
     veteran chefs from historically famous kalgooksoo restaurants to
     great success. Right now, The Korean Daily (Joong Ang Ilbo)
     newspaper in LA named Hangari Kalgooksoo as the busiest restaurant
     in LA with the longest lines.

   [20][Hangari.jpg]
   Photo from the tasting, I think

     The chef is bringing the same concept to the East Coast with his new
     restaurant, Hangari Noodle Company. The restaurant will feature two
     distinct categories of noodle dishes – kalgooksoo and Mil Myun.

     Kalgooksoo (literally “knife noodle”) is a noodle soup that is made
     using fresh hand-cut wheat flour noodles. It is served in large
     bowls of delicious broth and topped with garnishes that enhance the
     dish. The kalgooksoo menu will feature various flavor options
     including chicken, clam, seafood, kimchi and beef.

     Mil Myun is similar to naeng myun (literally “cold noodle”), but the
     incredibly thin noodles are made using the same dough used
     for kalgooksoo  The mil myun menu will feature various options such
     as Mul Mil Myun (noodles in a chilled broth), Bibim
     Mil Myun (noodles in a spicy sauce), Kimchi Mil Myun and Hong Uh
     (Skate) Mil Myun.

     A unique business strategy that the chef is taking will be offering
     customers a traditional Korean appetizer of bori bop (brown rice),
     dwen jang (Bean Paste) and yul moo  kimchi (young radish stem
     kimchi) free of charge with each order of noodles.  Because the
     noodles will be rolled out, cut and boiled fresh to order, the
     appetizer will keep customers happy while they wait for their food.

     Hangari Noodle Company is bringing a new concept to the area that
     I’m sure will be a hit! Koreans in the area with be delighted to
     finally have a kalgooksoo and mil myun speciality restaurant open in
     Maryland. And for non-Koreans, this restaurant will be a great new
     cuisine to try.  They are set to open very soon, with a tentative
     date for this weekend.

     I heard they had a secret tasting with the chef’s family over the
     weekend and everyone loved it.  I personally can’t wait to try their
     clam kalgooksoo!

   [21]One More Bite blog and[22] Yelp reviews.

[35]Sonic Says It Will Open Oct. 16 In Ellicott City

   The new Sonic on Rte 40 in Ellicott City will open on October 16,
   according to a[36] Facebook post spotted by Adam.
   This is on Rte 40 west of Rte 29.  It's definitely a joint with a loyal
   following.  Adam says he will aim for opening day:

     I plan to be there. It's overrated, yes, but it's been a few years
     since I reminded myself of that.  Where else are you going to get a
     corn dog, tots, and a shake all at the same time without ever
     leaving for car?

   The Sonic has been two-and-a-half years in the making.  The first
   report was [37]May 2012 by Wordbones.  It may be a while before I can
   try the shakes -- which Mrs. HowChow says are the highlight -- but I'll
   pour a little out for Wordbones.

[49]Center Park Grill Replacing Cafe De Paris

   It looks like a restaurant called Center Park Grill will replace the
   closed Cafe De Paris in Columbia.

[64]LA Chef Bringing Handmade Noodles To East Coast; First Step:
Catonsville's Hanoori Town

   An Los Angeles chef is opening his first East Coast location in
   Catonsville -- and bringing hand-cut noodles, reports Lisbeth of the
   [65]Lisbeth Eats blog.
   Lisbeth and I actually emailed weeks ago, and I overlooked her report
   about a new restaurant going into the shopping center with H Mart in
   Catonsville.  Down from the supermarket is a space called Hanoori Town
   that has three restaurants and a frozen yogurt store upstairs and a
   housewares store in the basement.
   A Korean-Chinese restaurant in Hanoori Town has closed, and a new
   restaurant specializing in handmade noodles is opening there.  The
   noodles are kal guk su, a Korean noodle dish served in large bowls of
   broth.  I don't have full details, but it's exciting enough that folks
   should know.  I'll update as I learn more.
   Here is Lisbeth's full email with a quick description of the
   restaurants in the Hanoori Town down from H Mart and some news about
   the new noodle restaurant that is coming:

     When you're standing in the parking lot facing Hmart, Hanoori Town
     is to the right.  There's a Korean food court on top with Korean
     retail stores (Asian housewares, gifts, beauty products, clothes and
     bedding) below.  When the place was called Besesto, I think
     everything was under the same person.  But it was reopened as
     Hanoori Town under new management about five years ago, and I think
     each individual shop is sub-leased under one owner. I think the
     owner wanted to create a space where different ethnicities could
     come together to shop and eat.  Hanoori means 'Us as one.'
     On the top floor there are actually three different restaurants --
     two to the left and one facing you as you walk in.  When we went
     there [in August], I heard that a new restaurant is going into the
     second space.

     So as you walk in, the first restaurant to the left is Bu Du Mak
     (closest to the window). They specialise in a cold noodle soup
     called naeng myun, Korean blood sausage called soon dae, and
     traditional Korean soups and stews.
     The restaurant next to Bu Du Mak was a Korean/Chinese noodle
     restaurant that specialised in jja jang myun (black bean noodles),
     jjam ppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and typical Korean/Chinese
     dishes like [66]Hanjoonggwan in Ellicott City.  But they are no
     longer there.  A new kal guk su restaurant is going into that space.
      The new chef/owner is famous in LA for his fresh hand pulled
     noodles and soup, and he's bringing it to the East Coast with his
     first location in Hanoori Town. I was told that it should be open in
     roughly late September.

     I love kal guk su  so I'm very much looking forward to checking them
     out. Kal guk su is well known in the Myung Dong neighborhood of
     Seoul.

     The restaurant facing you as you walk in is called Chan Mat and they
     offer all sorts of Korean food, Japanese sushi lunch buffet and I
     saw new signs for Korean/Chinese cuisine on their wall. I 'm
     guessing when the Korean/Chinese restaurant in the middle closed,
     Chan Mat added those items to their menu.

     I like the housewares store and the Korean bedding store in the
     basement. I got my shabu shabu pot from there and the Korean bedding
     shop in the back corner has lots of gift items and comfortable
     blankets, mats and pillows for the house.

[81]Huge Korean Festival In Columbia Saturday, And They Want You To Come For
K-Pop And Kimbab

   The Korean Society of Maryland is hosting a gigantic festival Saturday
   in Columbia -- making a giant invitation for folks to come for food,
   music and entertainment.
   The party will be at Centennial Park, and they're bringing in some
   big-name entertainment and serving Korean food from 10 vendors,
   including Honey Pig.
   Janene Holzberg [82]wrote a nice piece in the Sun on the festival and
   on the generational change at the Korean Society.  Festivities run
   10:30 am to 7 pm.  They even have two overflow parking sites -- all
   laid out in the Sun article.

[90]Did Frank's Seafood Close In Jessup?

   Details are sparse, but Frank's Seafood in Jessup may have closed.
   This would be a bummer.  Frank's was a retail store inside the
   wholesale seafood market.  They were an invaluable place for fish,
   seafood and crabs.  I got crabs there last month.
   Again I don't know details.  But the phone want answered this
   afternoon, and the Twitter and Facebook pages seem to be deleted.  A
   friend of mine who knows that market says Frank's has closed.  (Update:
    I have heard this from two other people as well, including Nicole who
   put a [91]comment on the HowChow Facebook page saying a guard at the
   seafood market said they have been closed since Monday.)
   Does anyone know details?  I would love to be wrong.  I assume that
   Frank's was hurt when Wegmans and Whole Foods opened big retail fish
   counters in Columbia.  I love both of those places, but I recognize
   that they are changing the landscaping and taking business from
   businesses that welcomed me when I moved to Howard County.

[102]German Revival: Beer & Wurst From Blob's Park Taking Over Gunning's
Space In Hanover

   I'm behind the times here, but the former owners of Blob's Park in
   Jessup have reopened as the Bavarian Brauhaus in Hanover, taking over
   the space that had been Gunning's.
   This is a German restaurant, and [103]its Facebook page says that it is
   open for business.  Steve gave me a heads up in early September.  I'm
   just getting my in-box under control.  Richard Gorelick had
   [104]written in June about the plans.
   In that article, owner Max Eggerl had said there wouldn't be space for
   the polka dancing that had been a major part of the Blob's Park
   experience.  But[105] the menu on their Web site looks like a broad
   selection of German and American food from sausages to schnitzels to a
   crab cake.
   (Update: Headline fixed from "Blog's Park" to "Blob's Park."  You can
   see where the blogger's mind lies.)
   Has anyone eaten at the Bavarian Brauhaus? How is the food?  How is the
   beer selection?  Thanks again to Steve for the tip.
   Bavarian Brauhaus
   7304 Parkway Drive South
   Hanover, MD 21076
   410-712-0300
   NEAR:  This is right on the Howard County line.  It's basically Rte 103
   just off Coca Cola Drive.  You can take the Coca Cola Drive exit south
   from Route 100, then turn left on Rte 103.  It's near Timbuktu. If I
   read Google Maps correctly, the Bavarian Brauhaus is just in Anne
   Arundel County, but it's the part that I claim.

[118]Whole Food Has House-Made Popsicles -- Juice Pressed, Mixed And Frozen
In The Store

                            [119][photo%2B5.JPG]
                     Store-made popsicles at Whole Foods

   Mrs. HowChow had looked in the window of the new[120] Columbia Whole
   Foods, so she knew that it was enormous when she told me that she only
   wanted one thing if I stopped on opening day.
   House-made popsicles.
   Whole Foods presses their own juices in the store on the Columbia
   lakefront.  Then they freeze them into 99-cent popsicles.  Little
   bundles of icy happiness.  Some adult flavors with kale and greens.
   But most are sweet and fruity.  They're definitely worth checking out
   if you're still exploring the new Columbia store.
   I'm still infatuated with the new Whole Foods.  I have gone the last
   two weekends and bought our food for the week.  I'm making a seasonal
   effort to cook whole grains, and the bulk section is a terrific way to
   try different stuff -- bulgar, quinoas, beans, etc.

[130]Victoria Gastropub Family Plans A Restaurant For Clarksville, No Timing,
Says Her Mind Mag

   The Marriner family that owns Victoria Gastropub has plans to open a
   restaurant in Clarksville -- including a name (FoodPlenty), but no
   timing, [131]reports Carol Sorgen in Her Mind magazine.
   No huge details in the article, which is a nice profile of the family
   and their plans for a brewery.  But Victoria is such a Howard County
   mainstay -- Mrs. HowChow ate with friends there on Sunday -- that
   another restaurant seems like news.
   Who knows more?  Where?  When?  What is the plan for FoodPlenty?  Hat
   tip to Cindy, who spotted the article and posted on the HowChow
   Facebook page.

[142]Ananda Breaks Into The County's Best Restaurants, Gets Raved By The
Sun's Gorelick

                         [143][photo%2B3%2B(9).JPG]
                   The shrimp dish jinga kararii at Ananda

   I tamped down my excitement when I first wrote about [144]Ananda.
   The Fulton restaurant is the closest food to my house, serving a
   cuisine that I love.  And I'm just a hobby blogger, which makes me
   reticent to act like I know exceptional food after a meal or two.
   But the professionals love Ananda, so I'm letting myself wax poetic.
   It's a new restaurant, but I think it already matches the best
   restaurants in Howard County.
   We had another amazing dinner last night.  Great cocktails.
   Spectacularly flavorful shrimp, chicken and dessert.  The class of
   white tablecloths and subtle waiters, paired with the friendliness of a
   veranda full of families and kids.  All as the cool evening rolled in
   through open walls.
   [145][photo%2B1%2B(22).JPG]
   It's a magical combination, and it's getting notice.  Todd Kliman of
   the Washingtonian mentioned Ananda on-line a few weeks ago --
   distilling t[146]he observation that the kitchen fuses Indian cuisine
   with a local seasonal vibe of a city bistro.  Then Kathy Patterson of
   Minx Eats [147]enjoyed both the drinks and food.  Then yesterday
   Richard Gorelick [148]gave Ananda four stars in the Sun:

     Ananda strives to evoke something of the same nostalgic feeling, and
     it succeeds. The atmosphere is sophisticated but not stuffy. . . The
     food — in particular, the items listed as house specials — is
     elegant, too.

   Boom.  Now I can say that I love the food without feeling like I'm
   infected with amateur-writer puppy love.  We have eaten three meals at
   Ananda, each better than the last.  This time, I ate the shrimp dish
   jingha karari and used rice and bread  to lap up every drop of the
   sauce rich with ginger and garlic.  Mrs. HowChow ate a chicken kabob
   that was juicy white meat chunks, cooked perfectly and then served with
   an herb sauce.  We finished with a special peach crumble that rivaled
   our favorite seasonal desserts at Woodberry Kitchen.
   Read the professional reviews.  They all capture the place -- and
   Gorelick goes respectful when he describes the Maple Lawn development.
    I'm amazed that Ananda's kitchen is serving recognizable -- even
   traditional -- Indian food in ways that seem unique.  It's a bit in the
   food itself.  A bit in their offering plated entrees.  My shrimp came
   with a choice of lentils or spinach as a side dish.  A bit in the local
   and seasonal specials like the watermelon salad that we ate on an early
   visit and that Gorelick raved about.
   We're not the only ones raving.  The table next to us last night
   ordered three watermelon salads for three diners.  It's so good that
   they didn't share.  We have neighbors who have gone with their toddler
   every Sunday night since Ananda opened.  They love the food, and
   they're making a family tradition.
   As I [149]wrote in my "first thoughts' post, Ananda has an atmosphere
   that welcomes toddlers in t-shirts and women in date-night dresses.
   You should try dinner on the veranda on a fall evening.  But I can see
   that Ananda will covert into a cozy, warm winter spot once they bring
   down those glass walls and turn up the fireplaces.  The bar and the
   interior dining rooms will give you all kinds of options.  Gorelick's
   review got a laugh in our house because he called out Ananda's three
   televisions.  It's a discordant sight here and in other really good
   restaurants.  You'll just need to look the other way.
   Ananda
   7421 Maple Lawn Blvd
   Fulton, MD 20759
    (301) 725-4800
   NEAR:  Ananda is in the Maple Lawn development just south of Columbia.
     It's on Maple Lawn Boulevard, which connects Rte 216 and Johns
   Hopkins Road just west of Rte 29.  Ananda is a stand-alone building.
   As of September, it had no sign.  It is across the parking lot from a
   Suntrust bank.

[170]A Great Breakfast Sandwich With Breakfast Sausage From Laurel Meat Or
Boarman's

   [171][photo%2B2%2B(21).JPG]
   I should have known that I already had the key to a great breakfast
   sandwich.
   A few weeks ago, I asked for suggestions after [172]trying the
   egg-cheddar-and-sausage croissant from Touche Touchet.  Folks
   recommended their favorites in the comments, but the '34 Act Gourmet
   came to my house with the answer.
   Breakfast sausage from [173]Laurel Meat Market.
   I have extolled sausage as[174] the gateway drug to try your local
   ethnic butchers.  Laurel Meat Market's loose breakfast sausage -- like
   the similar sausage that people love from [175]Boarman's in Highland --
   is the easiest gateway around.  Basic pork sausage flavored with sage
   and other spices.
   [176][photo%2B1%2B(20).JPG] We pressed out two patties.  I cooked them
   in a cast iron pan while two eggs fried in a skillet and some Wegmans
   bread toasted nearby.  Wegmans' bakery will slice any loaf, and the
   thin, even slices have made this a staple that I keep in the freezer
   for sandwiches or toast.
   Simple and superb.  I try to find delicious meat because I'd rather eat
   a small amount of the great stuff than a daily ration of the mediocre.
    Laurel Meat and Boarman's grind their own sausages, and they give a
   full-flavored mix that just tastes fresher and better every time.
   We had superb breakfast sandwiches in minutes, then went on about our
   day.
   If you're intrigued, check out a line of HowChow posts about meat and
   local butchers.  I did a survey of butchers a few years ago in [177]a
   longer post about places to shop, and I try to code [178]posts when
   they're about barbecue or grilling.

[188]Leelyn's Makes The Unmanly Chef Sing About His Supper; His E.C. Spot For
Soup, Salad, More

                     [189][14734422370_7e6f5dbd50_z.jpg]
                             The "Seasonal Salad"

   The Unmanly Chef cooks up a storm on[190] his own blog -- including a
   great [191]series of "Five Lunches, Five Days" where he recommends a
   recipe you can cook Sunday and then pack good food all week.
   But the Chef is a Howard County local, and he graciously offered to
   write up a joint that we haven't visited in years.  [192]Leelynn's is
   an Ellicott City spot just off Rte 108.  It's an American kitchen with
   a menu that changes and offers everything from drinks to small plates
   to big entrees.  As I remember, they have some nice outdoor seating,
   which will just get more cozy as we move into fall.
   The Chef has lived in Howard County for 27 years, so he remembers Lee
   Stumpf back from the years at G.L. Shacks, a local hangout.  Once they
   parted ways, Stumpf opened Leelyn's, and the Chef said it quickly
   became of his family's "go to" spots:

     There are so many things that I like about Leelynn’s, but I’ll
     rattle a few off before I get to my review.
     The first -- and I think most important -- is the sense of community
     you feel when you go there.  I dare you to go and not recognize
     someone.  You feel at home or like the Cheers theme song said,”You
     wanna go where everybody knows your name.”

   [193][14898110266_a31fcd32c0_z.jpg]
   The pork belly

     Second, it lacks any sort of pretentious, over the top salesmanship
     which I can’t stand. Their staff knows the menu well enough to give
     recommendations but they’re not going to hit you over the head with
     the menu, which I like. Finally, Leelynn’s has an adventurous
     kitchen which has always been fearless to try new menu items.
     A menu feature that I love about Leelynn’s is that they have a small
     plates menu.  For the crowd that doesn’t want a huge plate of food,
     this is a great feature.  This is the portion of the menu that
     changes often, so it’s hard to get sick of an item.  I am sad that
     they don’t do mac & cheese anymore, because it was unreal. Their
     chips are made in house and are stellar.
     They have unreal cream of crab soup.  It’s one of my favorites in
     Maryland.  I’ve eaten this soup all over the state, and Leelynn's
     tastes just as good as the soup at the Inn at Perry Cabin, one of
     the highest rated restaurants in the state.  It has plenty of jumbo
     lump crab meat to go long with a great cream soup.

[203]Here Come Brews #2 And #3, Updates The Sun

   With [204]Jailbreak Brewing in Laurel, Howard County got its first
   brewery this year.
   Now Julekha Dash of the Sun has written an update on the two other
   groups looking to open competitors -- [205]Black-Eyed Susan Brewing
   slated now to open this fall in Columbia and [206]Manor Hill Brewing
   Company in Ellicott City in 2015.
   I've visited Jailbreak, and this is a fun concept.  These breweries
   will sell most of their beer to restaurants and liquor stores, but they
   can run tasting rooms -- without kitchens -- where people can hang out
   and sample the beer.
   Jailbreak pairs with food trucks who operate in the parking lot.  It's
   a fun scene, and I assume both of the new places will aim for something
   similar.
   Check out [207]Dash's article for Howard Magazine.  And also check out
   an [208]April 2014 article by Sarah Meehan in the Baltimore Business
   Journal.  Both articles say Manor Hill will not have a retail scene
   like Jailbreak.  It says there may be private parties, but no tours
   because of traffic issues.
   Please comment below with any advice about Jailbreak's beers or any
   other news about plans by Black-Eyed Susan or Manor Hill.  Manor Hill
   is run by the folks who own [209]Victoria Gastro Pub, which makes me
   doubly interesting in how they'll mix food and drink even if it is just
   at the restaurant.

[217]Ali Baba And The 40 Donuts, A Story Of Sweets To End A Chinese Feast At
Grace Garden

                           [218][photo+1+(2).JPG]
                            Grace Garden's donuts

   This is what you get for being stereotypical:  Forty donuts.
   There were three of us, including one Chinese speaker at [219]Grace
   Garden in Odenton, and we were pretty stuffed from three entrees from
   the best Chinese restaurant in the area.  But we were enjoying the
   afternoon and finishing off our tea when our friend recommended the
   donuts.
   We looked at the menu, and, for about $5, there was a line for "40
   donuts."  That can't be right, we all agreed.  You know how Chinese
   restaurants have language issues.  I've seen stir-fried "prok."  I've
   seen "shimp."  That must be an order with four little donuts.  That
   would be perfect.  We just need four.
   Out came 40 donuts, maybe more.  They're each the size of a donut hole
   from one of the national chains.  Beautifully fried, warm and crisp but
   not oily.  Dusted with a large-flake sugar that created sweet crunch.
   These are a terrific dessert.  Probably smarter if you have four or six
   people to eat 40 donuts, but we hoovered most of them.  I concentrated
   on the section with the most sugar.
   I can't recommend Grace Garden's food enough.  It's one of my best
   restaurants of Howard County even though it is across the border in
   Odenton.  It's well worth the drive our Rte 32, and now it comes with a
   sweet ending.
   For more about Grace Garden, check out [220]Lisbeth's post on Lisbeth
   Eats.  As always, she has terrific photos, and she suggests her
   favorite dishes at what I consider the best Chinese food near Howard
   County.  Read [221]all my posts about Grace Garden to see what inspires
   you.

[232]Special Monthly Buffet At Mango Grove -- Drawing The No-Meat Crowd, Plus
Cool Kids

                        [233][photo%2B1%2B(18).JPG]
                 Big plates from Mango Grove's vegan buffet

   Anyone can love [234]Mango Grove because it serves some of the
   [235]best food in Howard County, but they're breaking out the welcome
   mat for a niche market -- that's still a welcome adventure for
   everyone.
   Okay, they're breaking out the dinner buffet, not the welcome mat.
   Mango Grove does [236]a lunch buffet most days with both vegetarian and
   non-veg options.  But the Columbia restaurant is adding a monthly
   dinner buffet with all vegan food and attracting a young, cool crowd in
   the process.  It's a partnership with the Humane League, which
   advertises the event and gets a donation as well.
   We stumbled on August's vegan buffet in mid-month, and it's a feast for
   about $20.  The buffet shows off what Mango Grove does best -- a mix of
   straight Indian food like spinach and chickpeas with Chinese-Indian
   dishes like "broccoli 65" and a noodle dish that is their version of
   chow mein.
   That broccoli 65 is a treat.  Deep-fried and spicy, it's a dish that
   will please even folks who don't normally like the green vegetable.
   But the best dish was jackfruit and potatoes, a savory curry that shows
   off the jackfruit's sweetness.  A guy at the buffet compared the
   consistency to pulled pork.  Not exactly, but it is a substantial dish
   that is really unique.
   The monthly buffet is clearly a treat for vegans.  But it's no
   compromise for anyone.  The food is really good, and you can always
   order off the menu if you need a dosa or some other dishes.  (Mrs.
   HowChow got a lassi, then hid it behind the wine list so that she could
   fit into the vegan crowd, but still have her yogurt shake.)
   Mrs. HowChow and I were amused because the Mango Grove crowd definitely
   took on a different look.  It's always fun to be in a restaurant full
   of happy chatter.  We're just not used to a crowd of tattooed
   20-somethings in an Indian restaurant.  A few older folks, a few kids.
    But it felt more like Fells Point than Columbia.  Bravo!
   I think the monthly vegan buffet will be the fourth Monday of every
   month.  That's what I wrote down, although I realize that doesn't match
   August 11.  Check out the [237]Human League's Facebook page for
   Maryland.  They posted about the August event, and they [238]say the
   September one will be on the 22d.  I assume they're publicize future
   ones.

[249]Steamed Dumplings At Manna: Mandu To Almost Fill The Void Of The Late
Honey Pig Dumplings

                           [250][photo(487).JPG]
              Steamed mandu from Manna in the Lotte food court

   For those in search of steamed dumplings after the closing of Honey Pig
   Dumpling last year, the time has come to slake your hunger on Manna.
   That's Manna's mandu -- $9 for a six-dumpling order -- in the photo
   above.  It's one of the stands in the food court next to Lotte in
   Ellicott City.
   We got the pork variety, and they're a tasty snack.  A bit less filling
   and a bit more dough pressed together at the top than [251]the Honey
   Pig variety on sale briefly at the new Lotte in Catonsville.  But
   they're a welcome find because we had loved the steamed mandu as a
   party food.  They re-heat beautifully in a steamer.
   The Lotte food court has a series of restaurants, each with a pretty
   large menu.  Does anyone have specific recommendations?  I have looked
   a few times, but I don't know what you suggest.
   Manna
   (in the back of the Lotte food court)
   8801 Baltimore National Pike
   Ellicott City, MD 21043
   410-480-5050
   NEAR:  The Lotte in the Golden Triangle shopping center has a connected
   food court.  This is the shopping center on Rte 40 just east of Rte 29.
    Manna is the stand all the way in the back.  They have a menu in signs
   above the register, including several ramen varieties.

[263]Hot, Hot, Hot: Why Nashville Laughs At Your Spiciest Fried Chicken
Through Fiery Tears

                           [264][photo(466).JPG]
                  The spiciest food that I have ever eaten

   At some point -- as I finished eating the chicken wing -- my brain gave
   clear instructions that I should stand up and run away from the only
   people who I knew in Nashville.
   I should have known there was trouble when the only local had said we
   had to visit Bolton's Spicy Chicken & Fish, then announced "I'll just
   have a soda."  Nashville has a "hot chicken" tradition where lethal
   quantities of cayenne and other spices are mixed into or spread onto
   fried chicken.  Bolton's is a concrete bunker of a restaurant where you
   take out or eat at one of the worn tables.  (See below.)
   Overall, this is delicious chicken, well worth an adventure if you
   visit Nashville.  On the main part of the breast, the ratio of moist
   white meat balanced out the crazy spice in the breading.
   [265][photo(465).JPG]
   Bon Chon's wings and pickled radish
   But eating the wing first was murder.  The red-stained breading was as
   thick as the meat on a wing.  Spice overwhelmed everything and filled
   my mouth.  I puffed out breaths.  I drank down Diet Coke.  I ate the
   pickles and white bread.  I actually had the urge to run away, flee the
   chicken, find ice water to dunk my  head.
   But I'm a guy.  The other two guys kept eating their chicken, so I kept
   going as well.  Our local stole a few slices, but it was the travelers
   who finished off the "sandwiches" and felt like they had their taste of
   Nashville.  I felt flames in my stomach for the rest of the day.  And
   that was Bolton's medium chicken.  I hadn't been crazy enough to start
   with the hot or the extra hot.
   For local chicken, the spiciest probably comes from the kitchen at
   [266]Bon Chon Chicken in Ellicott City.  That's a terrific spot.  They
   also serve pickled radish as a side dish.  Those cubes do wonders to
   cool off a fiery mouth  tongue.  The hottest local food is probably the
   [267]chili naan at [268]Tandoor Grill on Johns Hopkins Road, although a
   friend said that bread had been toned down a bit the last time that he
   ordered.
   Hot chicken at Bolton's reminded me that I need to return for pit beef
   at [269]Pioneer Pit Beef in Woodlawn.  That's our answer to a local
   delicacy cooked in shacks and concrete bunkers.  Ironically, I think my
   last lunch on Pioneer's picnic tables was with my Nashville buddy.  For
   the record, I ate exactly what I told him to eat.

[280]Thai Sauces -- Lemongrass! -- Inspire My Shopping At The Saturday
Farmers Market In Fulton

   [281][photo%2B3%2B(8).JPG]
   I thought that I would be good at CSAs and farmers markets, but I have
   never found myself making really good decisions about purchases or
   menus.
   I buy stuff, but I lose the energy and end up with something lost and
   rotting in the back of the produce drawer.  As I typed this, I
   remembered a clutch of Love Dove Farms carrots that I need to pickle
   today because we haven't touched them for 10 days.
   At my last visit to the new Fulton farmers market, I found my
   inspiration in a jar.  A jar of lemongrass sauce sold by Thai Spices, a
   stand run by some folks who I think also run a Thai restaurant in
   Baltimore.
   [282][photo%2B4%2B(4).JPG] The mason jar of sauce came packed with
   flavor and ideas.  You could have picked any number of sauces,
   including a "sweet n sour" or rad pik.  Either way, the sauce became
   the key to my shopping.  Carrots, tomatoes, potatoes and green beans
   from Love Dove and TLV Tree farms.  Then chicken breasts from TLV.
   I made two soups.  Slight variations where I made stock, then added
   tablespoons of lemongrass sauce. Poached one chopped chicken breast.
   Then removed the meat and cooked the vegetables.  First the stiff ones
   like carrots, potatoes and chard.  Adding a little more sauce until the
   flavor was strong.  Then the soft vegetables like tomatoes and green
   beans with the chicken to reheat.
   We got six bowls of soup from that chicken and sauce.  We even have
   some leftover sauce that could go into a stirfry.  I'm also inspired to
   try this again.
   Check out the Thai Spices stand.  They were also selling takeout
   packages of spring rolls and mango sticky rice.  That could make a nice
   snack as you walk around or that you carry home for lunch.
   The Fulton farmers market runs every other Saturday.  Check out
   [283]the spicy pepper jelly and all my posts about the [284]Howard
   County farmers markets.  For the real writing about seasonal cooking,
   check out the CSA and recipe reports on blogs like [285]AnnRie

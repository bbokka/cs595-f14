   The calm after the storm
   The heavens opened last week and my garden turned into a river. Don't
   get me wrong, we weren't flooded like the poor people of Hebden Bridge
   or Todmorden, but water flowed across the lawn nevertheless.
   I have a question for anyone who is likely to read this (hint of
   hopelessness in my voice). I planted all these courgettes at the same
   time, the soil in both levels of the plot is the same, all were started
   off in pots indoors, the only difference is that the back ones were
   planted out a week later than the front. Taking into consideration that
   they have been out in the garden for weeks, why haven't they caught up.
   Perhaps they are doing it out of spite!
   I found out last night that some silly soul has poured a whole load of
   tarmac at some time in the dim past onto part of the garden where I
   wanted to plant some fruit bushes. I felt rather like an archaeologist
   yesterday evening carefully scraping with a trowel round a large flat
   surface under the soil. Perhaps it's a beautiful buried Belfast sink
   that I can plant alpines in, perhaps it is the remains of some really
   nice garden paving - no, it's a huge chunk of tarmac which will have to
   be removed by pick axe!
   On the up side the plot is starting to yield some beautiful bounty, we
   have had a weekend of eating gooseberries.

   When the sun shines I have to admit the garden is starting to look
   rather pretty.

[11]Our love/hate relationship with weeds

   For several years now I have been battling with an interloper in my
   garden, It is definitely here uninvited, spreads itself round with
   unseemly abandon but causes no damage other than placing the colour
   orange where I feel it has no right to be. I have resented my
   profligate interloper for a long time, I have spent many (well, not
   that many) back breaking hours on my knees digging it out of the soil,
   but it is clearly still there.
   I remember reading somewhere the statement that 'weeds' are simply
   flowers in the wrong place. Try telling that to someone with a garden
   full of Japanese Knotweed. Something happened this weekend that made me
   scratch my head and think about just that, maybe it isn't that weeds
   are flowers in the wrong place, but more that they are flowers with the
   wrong names. After all Japanese Knotweed sounds strangulating and
   unpleasant doesn't it? In which case the opposite could possibly be
   true, a weed/flower causing a nuisance, if provided with the correct
   name, seems less of a problem.
   Back to this weekend's event. The Observer in Sunday arrived with a
   small guide to Britain's wild flowers and leafing casually through,
   what should take pride of place on page 20 but my Public Enemy Number
   One - Pilosella aurantiaca.
   Would you like to meet the profligate little devil, and before you do,
   would you like to know its common name? Fox and Cubs! Makes you feel
   all warm and fuzzy doesn't it? Me too. I shall still be weeding the
   little fellas out of my flower border because they do seem to breed
   like rabbits (by runners by the way, not actual plant sex), but I may
   just let them flower occasionally just so that I can say that I have a
   Fox and Cubs in the garden.

[16]Glutney Chutney

   Every year the time comes when you stand in the garden, stare at the
   allotment, scratch your head and think "what the **** am I going to do
   with all those marrows!" You know that you shouldn't have let them grow
   that big, you know that you shouldn't have gone away on holiday and
   left a non-courgette eating neighbour look after the plot and you know
   you should have cut your losses and given them all away. But there they
   are, just sitting there and staring back up at you saying "we're
   enormous and green and what the **** are you going to do with us?"
   [17][P1050507.JPG]
   This is almost direct theft from Hugh F-W's 'The River Cottage
   Cookbook', but I've pinched it from 'Preserves' by Pam Corbin, with a
   hint to Nigel Slater's Mixed Tomato Chutney. I hope none of them will
   sue me, but I have made the small addition of cardamom to the mix for
   no better reason than that I adore it!
   Ingredients
   (this makes just a couple of jars of chutney)
   450g marrows (peeled and diced)
   450g green tomatoes
   200g cooking apples (I use windfalls from the garden) peeled, cored
   and diced
   350g onions peeled and diced
   90g sultanas
   250g light soft brown sugar
   300ml cider vinegar
   2tsp yellow mustard seeds
   12 cardamom pods (husks removed but don't crush seeds)
   1 tsp salt
   1 medium sized red chili
   a good grind of black pepper
   Put all the ingredients, except the tomatoes in a heavy bottomed pan (I
   have just shelled out for a proper preserving 'jam pan' this year, but
   in previous year I have managed perfectly well in a big saucepan).
   Bring everything to the boil and leave to simmer for an hour, stirring
   it occasionally to prevent it from sticking.
   After about 25 minutes add the tomatoes and finish the cooking time.
   Spoon the delicious sticky stuff into sterilized jars and seal.
   This tastes better if you leave it for a while before you eat it
   (that's my advice, however I usually get stuck into it straight away).
   Can I just add that this is a perfectly brilliant accompaniment for
   plain cheese on toast!

[21]My mini allotment is growing up

   We have a had a lot or rain and I MEAN a lot, but the little sunshine
   we
   have had seems to be doing the trick, my vegetables are growing. I have
   never claimed to know what I am doing in the garden department and all
   that I have planted this year are really experiments, but it is looking
   good.
   [22][P1080107.JPG]
   In the garden this year:
   Courgettes (both yellow and green)
   Chard (both plain and 'bright lights')
   Dwarf beans
   Mangetouts
   Radish
   Sweet spherical carrots
   Pac choi
   Celeriac
   Kale
   Sweetcorn
   Strawberries
   Rhubarb
   Redcurrants
   Gooseberries
   It's amazing what you can shoe horn into a tiny space. Not all of it
   will be successful I know, but I'm enjoying that thrill of checking the
   plot out every morning to see how it's going. I have to add that the
   last four items on the list are not in the raised bed, but next to it
   on the railway banking.
   [23][P1080105.JPG]
   This Kale is dedicated to my dad (who built the raised bed) since he
   has informed me that he will be eating most of it!
   [24][P1080114.JPG]
   I know that this blog doesn't have a scratch and sniff facility, but I
   can guarantee that these strawberries and radishes were excellent!
   My only problem with having my own mini allotment is that I really
   should be keeping some sort of diary as a record of what was planted on
   which date, germination times and harvesting comments. If I put them in
   my blog I would probably bore people to death, if in fact anyone out
   there reads this (comments please!). In the meantime I will muddle on
   in disorganized chaos as per the rest of my life. I have kept three
   children alive and healthy, so I'm sure my garden will cope.

[41]An allotment is born

   When will this rain ever end, I half expect Noah to wave at me from his
   ark as he drifts down the road. Towards the end of the beautiful spring
   weather I half remember enjoying Dad and I took on a building project,
   to create a mini allotment in my garden.

   In case I haven’t explained this before, our house is
   situated next to a local rail branch line and despite the novelty of
   having our
   very own train set running through the garden , it also means that half
   of our
   garden slopes at an alarming angle.

   With timber from a local merchant my dad built a raised bed
   in two sections which, when filled with soil, should give plenty of
   growing
   room, the added advantage being that drainage should not be a problem.

   Once the sides went on I couldn’t wait to get it filled and planted
   and then the heavens opened for days on end, leaving me frustrated and
   with
   trays full of vegetable seedlings ready to go in the soil.

   The finished bed,
   however looks wonderful – thanks Dad!

[45]Whitby

   A fabulous day in Whitby, a place we hadn't visited in over 20 years.
   Though far more touristy now, the town still retains a wonderful
   honesty. Despite being the setting for Bram Stoker's Dracula, there
   were very few Goths in evidence. The sun shone and we managed to find a
   great 'dog friendly' cafe for lunch. Lets see of Blogger can now handle
   a few photographs - don't hold your breath!

   Quote of the day: "Outside of a dog, man's best friend is a book.
   Inside a dog, it's too dark to read!"

[49]Great bits of Liverpool

   We've been visiting Liverpool for years, trailing round the shops and
   declaring every time that we wished we'd gone to Manchester instead
   (please don't have a go at me ... I have university allegiances with
   Manchester and can't help it!).
   Today has been quite a revelation, getting slightly off the beaten
   track and out of the deadly boring Liverpool One, the photo
   opportunities have been glorious. The side streets remind me of
   Spitalfield and parts of the east end of London. One hopes that then
   powers that be will not rush to gentrify them, an action which will
   destroy their filthy charm. Mind you, under the present government,
   there's not much chance of that (now, now, no politics!). Liverpool has
   some of the most beautiful architecture in the north of England if you
   look behind the grime.
   One place in particular took me by surprise, the beautiful bombed out
   church of St. Luke on the hill above the city centre. Once a haunt of
   the marginalized and dispossessed, a neglected memorial to the victims
   of the bombing of Liverpool during WW2 and a rapidly disintegrating
   heap, it has now become a strange non religious spiritual magnet for
   those who drift in. Entry is only gained after signing a disclaimer
   rendering the owners blameless if you die a horrible death as the
   building collapses on you.
   The interior, which is really an exterior since there is no roof, has
   the ability to give you the shivers. On the day we visited Bach was
   playing loudly to the skies and filling every stone and alcove, flowers
   grew along the nave and photographs of the homeless of the city adorned
   the walls. I had to resist the urge to lie on the grass among the
   flowers, soak up the music and forget the outside world.
   Why is it so bloody hard to position photos in Blogger!!! If I try to
   add more pictures now I swear it will position them at the top of the
   post - you'll have to bear with me in cursing the designers of this
   prehistoric program.

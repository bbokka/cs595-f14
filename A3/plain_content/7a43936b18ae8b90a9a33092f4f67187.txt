[68]VH1 Love & Hip Hop: Music From The Series Set For August 19th Release On
Def Jam Recordings

   [69]Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 11.18.21 AM

   Def Jam artists Iggy Azalea, Common and August Alsina headline the
   all-star musical roster inspired by the hit franchise Love & Hip Hop.
   VH1 LOVE & HIP HOP: MUSIC FROM THE SERIES, is available everywhere on
   August 19^th, one day after the climactic season three finale of the
   series airing Monday night. The lead single from the soundtrack, August
   Alsina’s “No Love,” launches to radio on July 14^th.

   In addition to August Alsina (“No Love”), and Iggy Azalea (“F**k
   Love”), a host of stars from across the urban spectrum will be featured
   on VH1 LOVE & HIP HOP: MUSIC FROM THE SERIES : Gary Clark, Jr. (“Things
   are Changin’”), Emeli Sandé (“Maybe”), Matisyahu (“Live Like a
   Warrior”), Anthony Hamilton (“Sucka For You”), Trey Songz (“Heart
   Attack”), and many others. The soundtrack will also include “Love & Hip
   Hop” cast members Stevie J (“DNA”) and K. Michelle (“Can’t Raise A
   Man”). (See track list below)

   VH1’s hit series “Love & Hip Hop” debuted in 2011 and became an instant
   success and pop culture sensation. “Love & Hip Hop” and popular
   spin-off “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta” give fans an unfiltered look into
   the lives of those aspiring to make a name for themselves in the music
   industry. These movers and shakers will stop at nothing to get to – and
   stay – at the top. The much buzzed-about series delivers its signature
   brand of drama, music, temptation and love Monday nights at 8PM on VH1.

   VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop” is executive produced by Mona Scott-Young for
   Monami Entertainment and Toby Barraud and Stefan Springman for Eastern
   TV. Susan Levison, Nina L. Diaz and Vivian Gomez are executive
   producers for VH1.

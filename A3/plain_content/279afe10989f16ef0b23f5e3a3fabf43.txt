[3]REVIEW: Danity Kane 'DK3' Snippets & Review

Danity Kane DK3 Album Snippets

   [4][danity-kane-dk3-album-cover.jpg]
   Finally after the drama which the world saw after the DK4 reunion back
   in 2013 which was officially confirmed at the 2013 MTV VMA's, a lot has
   happened to girl group Danity Kane.
   They  have been in the studio recording music for their anticipated 3rd
   studio LP.  They went on a tour across the United States.  During the
   tour is when things began to take a torn for the worst.  First Aundrea
   Fimbres announced she was not going to continue on with Danity Kane
   because she wanted to start a family.  Next Danity Kane released a
   comeback single "Lemonade" featuring Tyga, which had great initial buzz
   but fizzled off after a video and promo didn't help push the potential
   Urban summer hit.  Following the tour in early August an altercation
   broke out in a studio/meeting session when Dawn Richard allegedly
   punched Aubrey O'Day unprovoked in the back of her head.  Then once
   again Danity Kane AKA DK3, officially broke up.
   Fans were left in awe at the girls for continuously promoting
   sisterhood, women respect, ladies coming together,  and overall love
   for eachother only to let an argument turn physical and ruin the
   business the three ladies worked so hard to create once again.
   Out of nowhere Aubrey and Shannon Bex released a video on Instagram
   confirmed since the fans never gave up they didn't either and that an
   album would be released for the fans as a gift.  Which is a bit odd,
   because its a gift in which fans will have to pay for.  Oxymoron.
   Well, here is my review of the tracks from the snippets

[21]VW Jetta Key Stuck In Ignition Problem [Solved]!

   [22][54502325.jpg]
   So I am not a part of one of those car blogging problem/answer sites so
   I figured I'd blog about my findings so that I could potential help
   another Google or Internet user who found themselves in the same
   trouble I was in.
   So I came home from work and atemped to turn of my 2000-2005 style VW
   Jetta.  Only to find the key would NOT release from the off position.
   Eeeeeek, I was panicking because I work the next few days. Don't wanna
   miss out on hours and spend a fortune!
   To make a long story short, I tried various things people on Google
   searches sites said to do.  Didn't work.  BUT with the idea of a friend
   from back home along with help from my sister, combined with the idea
   of a Google search.  ALL was fixed!

[27]New Music [Well Sort Of]: Enrique Iglesias & Jennifer Lopez "Mouth2Mouth"

   [28][jennifer-lopez-enrique-iglesias-mouth2mouth.jpg]
   After his re-emergence to the Pop music scene back in 2010 thanks to
   hits featuring Pitbull ["I Like It"] and Ludacris ["Tonight (I'm
   Fuckin' You)"] who else could Enrique Iglesias have worked with to
   continue his string of perfectly crafted Pop hits?  No one else but the
   queen of Latin Dance Pop music, Jennifer Lopez, is who! Check out their
   somewhat new* song "Mouth2Mouth" below!

[36]Who Should The X Factor US Panel Cast?

   [37][xfacto-changes.jpg]
   Seeing as how X Factor US has seen nearly all of the staring
   panelist/cast fired... The question arises, who should replace Steve
   Jones as host, and Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger as
   judges/mentors?  But first, lets take a look at some names that have
   been floating around who probably should not become a part of the
   singing competition's panel.
   Anybody who currently is experiencing the height of their popularity,
   should all be ruled out.  There is no need to risk joining the show and
   stopping your current streak.  So that takes out artists like Katy
   Perry (who although would be a great judge-she's currently way too
   successful), Rihanna (way too young to be tied down to a show that
   could affect her top of the pops standing), and even Beyonce (though
   her music career is sagging, she is still in her prime). Now for those
   who'd make great X Factor Judges!

  [49]The X Factor US Panelist Massacre!

   [50][149837219_X_Factor_USA_Promo_01_122_773lo.jpg]
   So after a super lukewarm debut season, of The X Factor US, Simon Cowel
   decided to make some major changes.  Apparently Cowel wasn't as OK with
   the average 12 million weekly audience, as he led on.  Prior to the
   shows debut, Cowel actually had hopes for the show to have ratings in
   the 20 million range.  Well that did not happen.
   So Cowel has decided to let go not one or two, but three members of the
   starring staff, so far!  It doesn't seem too surprising that the host,
   Steve Jones got the boot.  After all throughout the entire season Jones
   struggled to show any sympathy to exiting contestants [remember after
   Lakoda Rayne was voted off, he responded with: how does it feel now
   that your dreams are over?], being really stiff, and repeatedly cutting
   off the judges critiques in a rude manner.
   Next up on the chopping block, no one other than the former supposed to
   be co-host, turned Cheryl Cole replacement judge Nicole Scherzinger.
   After all, why was Scherzinger a judge in the first place?  Seriously
   on paper her only true successes includes her short lived stint as the
   PussyCat Dolls [DEL: only :DEL] lead singer.  Her solo career has never
   been able to take off in the U.S.  And if we're counting X Factor US
   marks Scherzinger's 4th competition reality show [Pop Stars, Dancing
   With The Stars, The Sing Off, X Factor US].
   Now for the final and probably most shocking departure...no one other
   than Cowel's former American Idol co-panelist Paula Abdul!  Seems kind
   of odd right, Simon did bring her onto the X Factor in the first
   place.  My guess as to why she left...  Bringing back the old Idol
   chemistry they had, that viewers loved-simply wasn't there like it used
   to be.  Though Cowel has openly stated he will soon work again
   with Abdul in the future.  So at least she is leaving on good terms
   with him, or is she?
   That leaves only Simon and L.A. Reid as judge.  Wondering why Reid
   didn't get the boot?  Well Reid did recently become the new A&R of the
   restructured Epic Records, so who knows... maybe Cowel sees Reid's
   appointment at Epic Records as another option for X Factor contestants
   to potentially get signed to.  That's smart!
   Guess the early on replaced Cheryl Cole may have had the last laugh...
   seeing as how her replacement was fired-she obviously didn't out
   perform her!
   What did you think of the firings?  post comments below!

[59]New Tune: "My Moment"

   [60][RB.gif]
   She strikes again!  And not just as a cameo feature in a music video
   [see Katy Perry's epic "[61]Last Friday Night (TGIF)" video]!  The now
   14 year old Rebecca Black is back once again with a new song, called
   "My Moment."  Black sent the YouTube world ablaze with her viral video
   "Friday" which has since been pulled from YouTube due to copyright
   issues after reaching over 165 million views.  Have no fear she is back
   with a new song, where she is ready to tell the world it is her moment,
   and she's ready to grab it.  Check out the video below!

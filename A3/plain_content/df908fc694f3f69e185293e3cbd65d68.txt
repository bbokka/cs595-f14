Parody Pink

     [114]kazerad:

     Last Christmas, while preparing for a family gathering, I continued
     the long and arduous process of ensuring every child in my extended
     family is raised exactly the way I was: surrounded by an
     inexhaustible supply of Legos.

     image

     The children had aged a lot since I first began my endeavor to
     produce clones of myself. I had already upgraded them from the
     larger, colorful blocks to the more advanced models and it was
     getting time to take that next step into functional things with
     working mechanical parts. For the boys, this was easy: there was no
     shortage of complex machines with a variety of versatile pieces,
     marketed to look more action-packed and enticing than a backhoe has
     any right to be. For the girls, though, I was faced with a different
     problem entirely.

     On one hand, I didn’t want to have the little girls open their
     presents and think I had accidentally given them something meant for
     their brother. It’s bad enough that I had forgotten all these
     children’s names and solely referred to them by their height and
     hair color; I didn’t want to make it look like I had forgotten
     their genders too. Not to mention if they just ended up trading the
     presents to a sibling, I would have failed in my attempt to create
     clones of myself.

     On the other hand, I didn’t want to enforce gender roles on these
     small children. If you look at the Lego products that are marketed
     toward girls, they’re not very… Lego. They have a strong focus on
     characters and accessories, and any actual building is typically
     limited to very simple tables, countertops, and other elements of
     interior decorating. Something with building versatility or actual
     mechanical functions was completely out of the question - the
     closest you got was this “inventor workshop” that was ultiimately
     little more than a doll representing the concept of invention.

     image

     How do the chemical vials and microscope relate to her mechanical
     work? Who knows. The math on the chalkboard isn’t even actual math;
     it’s just “A+D = C”. It’s the concept of algebra. This might be more
     excusable if it wasn’t coming from Lego; while boys are marketed
     [115]actual robotics kits, girls are effectively marketed a toy of a
     toy.

     I was raised pretty gender-neutral. My parents got me Polly Pockets
     and stuff right alongisde my action figures, and it wasn’t until I
     was much older that I learned about that implicit divide between
     “girl activities” and “boy activities”. I didn’t want to start
     pushing these kids into strict gender roles just by trying to get
     them a gift that was clearly for them, but I wasn’t quite sure what
     to do.

     So, I consulted a Lego Store employee on the matter.

     image

     She suggested I get something gender neutral for the girls. While
     everything mechanical and functional was very explicitly marketed
     toward boys, she pointed out to me that their Creator line was much
     more neutral. It had the pieces to build colorful houses and animals
     and stuff. If the girls liked it, maybe they’d eventually move on to
     the more advanced things in spite of the masculine marketing. That’s
     what she did.

     I wasn’t entirely happy with it, but it was the best I had. I went
     with some gender-neutral-yet-overly-childish-looking animal-building
     kits for the girls, and some running cars and machinery for the
     boys. The presents went over well; as usual I was totally the cool
     relative who made everyone else’s presents look lame. The experience
     was something that stuck with me, though. It was the first time I
     really came face-to-face with this curious absence not just in
     Lego’s product line, but in the market in general.

     Pink Gears

     image

     Lego makes no pink gears.

     I mean, yeah, sure, girls don’t have to like pink things. They’re
     allowed to shop in the whole toy store, not just the Fabled Pink
     Aisle, and there are plenty of gray and black gears out there should
     they choose to play with them. But why is there this necessity to
     sideline femininity if you want to explore these things?

     I read an [116]interesting piece recently by a game writer who made
     the rather poignant statement that sexism comes at her from two
     directions: in the male-dominated technology field she was expected
     to pretend to be “one of the guys”, while in the female-dominated
     publishing field she was expected to be a “proper woman”. I think
     this highlights the important point: sexism does not favor men or
     women, but dichotomy - the real losers being the stereotype-breaking
     people whose interests don’t cleanly fall into either the
     male/female category. We don’t do much to recognize those who
     straddle the divide, and this means we get no pink gears.

     This is pretty silly, though. There is nothing explicitly masculine
     about engineering or robotics. In fact, it has some very
     traditionally feminine elements that I think you could play up into
     a brilliant marketing angle. Machines can be delicate, intricate,
     and beautiful. An action-packed piece of boxart showing a fast car
     skidding across a muddy highway is just as representative of
     mechanical creation as an elaborate piece of clockwork.

     In fact, watch, I’ll come up with a Lego product line right now:

     image

     On the low-price end, I went for a hummingbird. I figure it’d come
     with alt instructions to rebuild it into a dragonfly or butterfly or
     something, and basically be playing up this idea of turning circular
     motion from a crank into up-and-down motion to animate wing
     flapping. Maybe it could even make that conversion twice: a cable
     going up the stalk being pulled back and forth would be converted
     back into gear rotation, which would then power the wing flapping.
     It’d entail enough small parts that you could make some cool stuff
     with it.

     On the mid-tier, I went for a kitten. I figure it’d be built around
     a pouncing function, its associated muscles rigged up with rubber
     bands. You could wind it up (maybe an excuse to use a worm screw?)
     and then hit its tail or something and it could probably clear at
     least three feet of air. Throw in some alt instructions for a turtle
     or something that can use the same spring principles for a wind up
     engine that makes it turtleflop across the ground.

     For the highest priced bit, I’d go for a panther. Swap in green
     gears for pink to make it more special, have lots of sparkly green
     parts to accent the black. I’m envisioning this being motorized -
     large felines have a very iconic walk cycle, and I think the right
     parts could simulate it pretty well. Heck, depending how good its
     designer is maybe you could even have a secondary motor that will
     bend its midsection and shift its weight to the side so you can
     actually steer its movement. Alt instructions would probably be a
     dolphin or something; instead of a walk cycle it’d just be on wheels
     and animate its fin/tail movement.

     You could market these things in an extremely feminine way. Like, go
     full Lisa Frank on the fucking box art. They’re pretty and they play
     up an angle to robotics and creation you don’t see in toys much. And
     not just that, but it goes all the way up - it’s not just some
     gateway drug to get girls to buy the trucks and racecars, but rather
     a whole line of robotics that plays up traditionally feminine
     elements. Girls could buy it without feeling like they’re
     sacrificing their femininity to experiment with these interests.
     Boys would uncomfortably buy it and defend its awesomeness to their
     friends. It would make so much money.

     Companies are apparently afraid of money, though, since this hasn’t
     happened yet. Well, maybe the truth is a little more complicated
     than that.

     Breaking Patterns

     image

     I frequently refer to myself as an Overglorified Fanfiction Author
     because it’s funny. There’s a lot of humor in the fact that I’m best
     known for writing a story based off an eight-year-old video game,
     and calling it “fanfiction” highlights the sheer ridiculousness of
     the entire situation. When you get down to the specifics, however,
     the stuff I write isn’t fanfiction - it’s parody.

     The distinction is an important one that a lot of people miss when
     they try to undertake similar projects. There are tons of people who
     try to do Elder Scrolls-inspired stories that very accurately or
     realistically chronicle their experiences in the game, yet such
     stories quickly fade out of existence without you ever hearing about
     them. Sometimes it’s even by people who really love the source
     material, but they’re simply not saying anything about it. You saw
     the same phenomenon in the Homestuck fandom at its apex: hundreds of
     people coming up with their own “Sburb Groups” of internet friends
     and chronicling their adventures into the Medium. They saw a formula
     that worked, and they struck out to imitate it.

     I think this is sort of the same mentality that drives gendered
     marketing. People know it works - products that hit every stereotype
     of masculinity have an audience among men, and products that hit
     every stereotype of femininity have an audience among women. So,
     creators make fanfiction that tries to capitalize off these
     successes, showing reverent respect and homage toward the companies
     that have sold better than them.

     And you rarely see that proper sense of parody toward these things.
     Like, you don’t see that drive that makes a creator simultaneously
     imitate and attack something. It’s baffling, because when this does
     happen it’s often wildly successful. Who would’ve thought to take
     the traditionally masculine concept of monsters and zombies and
     build a line of fashion dolls around it? Who would’ve thought to
     build a setting and adventure cartoon around traditionally feminine
     palettes and iconigraphy? These are ideas of parody - attacking the
     problems or monotony of a concept while simultaneously paying it
     homage, and it’s something that can generally only be created
     through a conscious effort to do just that.

     People who just try to ignore gender stereotypes alltogether often
     fall into them anyway. Like a fantasy author who insists his story
     isn’t just Star Wars with dragons, people tell themselves that
     they’re not going to play their work into gendered stereotypes, but
     then do it anyway simply because they’ve come to view it as how
     things work. To make things worse, they don’t even call the
     resultant work “masculine” or “feminine” - they play into the
     stereotypes exactly but give it names like “serious”, or
     “pro-social”. In an attempt to be progressive with their language,
     they make an implicit statement that women are frivolous and men are
     antisocial.

     It’s something I think you can only really circumvent through
     intentional parody. You need to find that middleground that sexism
     attacks and openly start dancing around in it. Mock the work of
     others; acknowledge the established rules and violate them anyway.
     You need to be a beacon or weirdness that spurs other people to
     stand along with you, until in time you have created a bastion where
     your unconventional tastes are Just Plain Okay.

     Market Mercenary

     image

     You don’t defeat ideas by criticizing them. You defeat them by
     outcompeting them.

     Far too few people recognize that criticism is a means to an end:
     you isolate the problems with something so that you can eventually
     render it powerless or irrelevant.

     As I established at the beginning, Lego’s approach to gendered
     marketing left me without a satisfactory solution in my attempts to
     build a clone army. I’m probably not the only one who feels this
     way. There is an untapped money mine here while creators continue to
     pick away at the long-hollow ridges at each end of the gender
     spectrum.

     This isn’t just something that affects big companies. If you’re a
     creator, stop making fanfiction and start making parody. Be honest
     with yourself - no matter how original you think your work is,
     you’re paying homage to something you like. Recognize this, and poke
     a little fun at it instead. Address your biggest criticism. Combine
     it with something else you like. Do something no one else would ever
     think of doing. Don’t think it will work? Well it’ll definitely work
     better than a straight-up rehash of something else.

     The worst thing you can do is nothing new. Remember that the next
     time you make your gears gray.

     You don’t defeat ideas by criticizing them. You defeat them by
     outcompeting them.

     ^^^ the best thing i ever heard get said

     I’d buy those kits in a heartbeat for myself.

     let’s talk about ‘the saga begins’ tho

     Don McLean was reportedly pleased with “The Saga Begins”, a parody
     of “American Pie”, and told Yankovic that the parody’s lyrics
     sometimes enter his mind during live performances. His parody not
     only replicates the music from the original Don McLean song, but it
     replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and
     chorus. Additionally, George Lucas loved the song and a Lucasfilm
     representative told Yankovic, “You should have seen the smile on his
     face.”

[167]POLL: Should the Washington Redskins Name be Banned From tv and radio? →

   [168]allofthefeelings:

     [169]stayoutofitnick:

     So this poll appears to have been targeted only towards those that
     agree. As of now, there are over 4,000 votes claiming the name is
     “respectful” and should not be banned from tv (no votes) and about
     100 votes to ban it (yes votes). While I don’t think outright
     banning is the solution, I hate that this is wildly skewed towards
     the distorted and offensive position that the name somehow shows
     respect.

     What do you think, guys? Can we swing it the other way by sharing it
     outside the self-reassuring network?

     Y’all, “yes it is offensive” has 4% of the votes. We can do better
     than this.

[9]Leftover Buttermilk Part 3: Matcha Green Tea Pancakes

   [10]May 24, 2014 / [11]fbudiman / [12]Leave a comment

   AKA LAST BUTTERMILK POST EVER!

   I’m so sick of trying to use up all the leftover buttermilk I got, so I
   actually still have some left in my fridge (omg 3 – 4 recipes later HOW
   IS THIS POSSIBLE) but whatever… You just rot away. I am so done with
   you.

   I actually went back to the [13]cupcake recipe (where it all began) and
   made another batch also. But this time, I didn’t have any butter,
   cream, or anything that I can make frosting with. Plain vanilla cake
   with no frosting?  That sounds like such a snooze fest. So I mixed in
   some butterscotch chips into the batter and baked it like usual.
   Honestly, this turned out AMAZING. Frosting is not even necessary. I
   didn’t take any pictures though, because this post is about the MATCHA
   GREEN TEA PANCAKES!

   Anyway, this one will be a quickie. I didn’t actually use any specific
   recipes, I kinda just took what I knew about regular pancakes and
   adjusted the recipe to my liking.

   INGREDIENTS
   This makes about 8 5-inch pancakes. In other words,
   kinda-small-to-medium-pancakes.

   2 cups all purpose flour
   2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
   2 teaspoons baking powder
   2 1/4 teaspoons matcha green tea powder
   1 1/4 cup buttermilk + 1/4 cup water
   2 eggs
   1 tablespoon melted butter

   And the directions are so ridiculously easy. I can probably summarize
   in one sentence: dump all ingredients into one bowl, mix, and then make
   your damn pancakes on a buttered pan.

   But I’m gonna write it out anyway.

   DIRECTIONS

   1. Put your flour, sugar, baking powder, and matcha powder into a
   mixing bowl. Whisk together.

   [14]pancake 1

   2. Then add your eggs, buttermilk/water, and melted butter into the
   flour mixture. Mix until combined. Do not over mix, lumps are fine
   (although not too lumpy if you know what I mean) (seriously).

   [15]pancake 2 [16]pancake 3 [17]pancake 4

   3. Heat up your pan and toss in some butter and let it melt. Make sure
   you slide that butter around to get that pan alllllll evenly buttered
   up.

   4. Ladle your pancake mix onto the pan and let the batter just chill
   there for a bit. When it bubbles a little at the top or the sides, flip
   that bitch. Repeat until light brown on both sides. I kinda like my
   pancakes a little bit more crispy on the outside, so I let mine get a
   little bit darker than just light brown.

   5. Stacks on stacks on stacks. Use maple syrup, butter, powdered sugar,
   fruits, chocolate chips, or top it with some face cream or shaving gel
   or whatever you want! Your pancakes, your rules.

   And that is all. Have yourselves a nice breakfast and a great weekend.

[22]Leftover Buttermilk Part 2: Oven Fried Chicken

   [23]May 23, 2014May 23, 2014 / [24]fbudiman / [25]Leave a comment

   So here we are again with this buttermilk……. Here… we… are…………

   Alright, well so this buttermilk is taking over my life, no big deal.
   Not sure if there is a part 3, but part 2 cometh from the great Ina
   Garten once again – original recipe [26]here.

   I have been craving some good gooooood fried chicken. Work has been
   slow recently, so all I do is look up foods to eat and I got stuck on
   fried chicken. Good ol fried chicken. I wish I had a waffle maker too.
   Well, if I’m wishing for stuff, I also wish I had a deep fryer so I can
   make all kinds of fried goods. Deep fried everything… whoa. I suppose
   it’s to my benefit that I don’t have one……. I suppose..

   So the recipe is pretty simple. Ingredients are:

   2 chickens (3 pounds each), cut in 8 serving pieces
   1 quart buttermilk
   2 cups all-purpose flour
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
   1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
   Vegetable oil or vegetable shortening
   Thanks to this recipe, I now know that I am not made to butcher
   chicken. I was SO close to getting a whole chicken and butchering it
   myself… then I realize… fuck. that. HaaaaHAhHa I have delicate fingers.
   So I got several things of thighs, drumsticks, and breasts
   (pre-butchered fasho)…….. and man, those breasts were huge. Seriously
   some of the biggest (chicken) tits I’ve seen. So anyway, I tried to
   make them a little smaller and I dunno wtf happened, but I ended up
   deboning them. And not very well.

   Now I know.

   And now here is Ina to grace you with her wisdom on how to oven fry
   some chickens. Oh and pictures.

   1. Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk
   over them. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

   (And here we have my bowl o chicks. And that damn buttermilk. And then
   both the chicks and buttermilk cuddling.)

   24 hours later:

   [30]fried chicken 4

   Oh that is not chicken. This would be my dog. I thought he looked extra
   happy so I took a picture :) And he recently got a summer cut, so he
   looks SO SKINNY and funny looking, but actually he’s pretty fat and
   usually very fluffy.

   Alright, back to the chickens:

   2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
   3. Combine the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Take the
   chicken out of the buttermilk and coat each piece thoroughly with the
   flour mixture. Pour the oil into a large heavy-bottomed stockpot to a
   depth of 1-inch and heat to 360 degrees F on a thermometer.

   [31]fried chicken 5

   NOTE: I added half a tablespoon of chipotle chili powder because I love
   spicy food. I made 2 batches – one with the chili powder, and one
   without. Make sure you don’t put in shitty quality spices, because if
   they ain’t fine enough, they burnzzz. Sizzzzzzzzzzle

   [32]fried chicken 6
   4. Working in batches, carefully place several pieces of chicken in the
   oil and fry for about 3 minutes on each side until the coating is a
   light golden brown (it will continue to brown in the oven). Don’t crowd
   the pieces. Remove the chicken from the oil and place each piece on a
   metal baking rack set on a sheet pan. Allow the oil to return to 360
   degrees F before frying the next batch. When all the chicken is fried,
   bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is no longer pink inside.
   Serve hot.

   [33]fried chicken 7  [34] fried chicken 8  [35] fried chicken 9

   (just for your pleasure, you can see my beautiful toes in that last
   pic)

   I also double breaded some of the chickens, and if you like extra
   crispy crust, then you should try that too. This is also a pretty hefty
   recipe. The chickens pictured are only like 1/5 of the whole recipe. I
   ate chicken for 2 whole days.

   Overall, what did I think? YUM. I personally liked the buttermilk tang,
   and I actually probably preferred the salt-and-pepper-only seasoning.
   The chili powder didn’t add much, turns out it wasn’t even that spicy.
   The skin was crispy and flavorful. The chicken was juicy and tender.
   Don’t be afraid to use salt!

   A couple things I thought I would mention…

   Metal baking rack. I was a little puzzled as to where to find this,
   because I found some roasting racks at my local grocery store but they
   were… different. They were all like… slanted and hooks everywhere and…
   just.. ohmygod so complicated. So I googled to see if you can use
   cooling racks to bake with, and apparently you can. So that’s what I
   did. But make sure they are metal and not coated with teflon or
   anything like that.

   Also, the bottom side of my chickens came out a little soggy after the
   oven. I thought the baking rack would stop that from happening but
   nope. So after that first batch, I flipped the chickens over about
   halfway in the oven. Make sure you kind of blot the oil off it too, so
   it doesn’t sog up your beautiful oven fried chicks.

   So where will this buttermilk take me next? Yeah I dunno. I’m running
   out of flour. I’m also running out of vanilla….. I am still loaded up
   on buttermilk lol. Well, ok maybe like a good 1/3 of the carton
   left………. stay tuned kids.

[36]Leftover Buttermilk Part 1: Buttermilk Cheddar Biscuits

   [37]May 17, 2014 / [38]fbudiman / [39]Leave a comment

   Clearly I’m hung up on this buttermilk. Probably because I made two
   trips to get it, and I ended up with the biggest size carton possible,
   and it’s not even 100% fat (I like em fat), so I just feel like I
   should use it. And if you’re clever, you probably got from the title
   that if this is part 1, there is definitely part 2.

   So I run into this problem constantly… I buy ingredients to cook or
   bake something, and I have tons of leftover ingredients. Not talking
   about flour or sugar or whatever – those pantry items can last for a
   while, but perishable things like dairy products (ahem I’m talking to
   you buttermilk, whipping cream, milk, sour cream, etc.), or onions,
   lettuce, cilantro, or things like that. I looked up ways to store food
   so they can last forever and ever like your parents’ marriage (yikes),
   but I end up forgetting about them so they go bad anyway……… lol I
   figure the only solution to this is to use them up ASAP. And that is
   what I intend to do. Buttermilk Ima use you up good. You’re not going
   bad under my watch.

   I looked up a whole bunch of recipes that call for buttermilk and found
   one by Ina Garten that seemed simple enough – buttermilk cheddar
   biscuits. Original recipe [40]here. It helps that I already had all the
   required ingredients, except for the cheese. And of course I need the
   cheese. I always need the cheese. Oh this is also annoying, when I try
   to use up leftover ingredients, and I use recipes that require
   something I don’t have, so I go back to the grocery store to pick up
   said missing item, and I end up having leftovers of that item, and then
   I gotta use it up so I just repeat……………. omg this is the worst. Cycle
   of never-ending leftover ingredients.

   Alright, enough bitching.

   Ingredients (this is changed a little to reflect what I used):

   2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
   1 tablespoon baking powder
   3/4 teaspoon salt
   12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold butter – frozen and grated
   1/2 cup cold buttermilk, shaken
   1 cold extra-large egg
   1 cup grated medium Cheddar (ok Ima be real. I’m pretty sure I used
   like more than 1 1/2 cups)
   1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water

   The original recipe calls for kosher salt (and double the amount),
   which I don’t really work with, and I’m not too invested in salt to buy
   a thing of kosher one when I needed only a little bit of it (I know, I
   know). Some people are very particular about their salt though. I read
   through the comments for the recipe, and a lot of people say the recipe
   is too salty because they use regular salt. So I think 3/4 tsp is a
   good amount.

   It also calls for cold butter that’s been diced. I happened to have
   frozen butter, so I just grated it and cut my work in half. Ish. You
   should try it. There’s something really satisfying about grating up
   butter. So. Smooth.

   [41]bc biscuits 1 [42]bc biscuits 2 [43]bc biscuits 3

   I was extremely tempted to add bacon pieces into this biscuit. SO
   tempted. But I didn’t. This is the cheese’s time to shine, bacon will
   have to wait their turn. Plus I didn’t wanna have leftover bacon
   rotting in my fridge. JUST KIDDING! LEFTOVER BACON? Ludicrous.

   And the cheese. I was very liberal with it because I love cheese. It
   was actually perfect. I used medium cheddar, because I was looking for
   extra sharp cheddar and found it to be about 6-7 bucks a block. And
   this block is about half the size of the medium cheddar (which means
   I’d need to buy 2), and also twice the price. So if my cheddar’s
   sharpness is worth 14 bucks, then I’m gonna go with the 3 dollar
   cheddar that is not as sharp…………… Hm there’s a life lesson somewhere in
   there.

   Ok here is a word for word, copied and pasted recipe from the website.
   I just posted it so you can still pay 100% attention to me. Not Ina.
   Me. Ina has her own show, this is all I gots.

   Directions

   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
   Place 2 cups of flour, the baking powder, and salt in the bowl of an
   electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on
   low, add the butter and mix until the butter is the size of peas.

   [44]bc biscuits 4

   Combine the buttermilk and egg in a small measuring cup and beat
   lightly with a fork. With the mixer still on low, quickly add the
   buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and mix only until moistened.
   In a small bowl, mix the Cheddar with small handful of flour and, with
   the mixer still on low, add the cheese to the dough. Mix only until
   roughly combined.

   [45]bc biscuits 5  [46] bc biscuits 6 [47]bc biscuits 7  [48] bc
   biscuits 8

   Dump out onto a well-floured board and knead lightly about 6 times.
   Roll the dough out to a rectangle 10 by 5 inches. With a sharp, floured
   knife, cut the dough lengthwise in half and then across in quarters,
   making 8 rough rectangles.

   [49]bc biscuits 9

   Transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with
   the egg wash, sprinkle with salt, if using, and bake for 20 to 25
   minutes, until the tops are browned and the biscuits are cooked
   through. Serve hot or warm.

   [50]bc biscuits 10

   Alright but I did NOT do rectangle biscuits. I like em round. Hm. Got a
   total of 16 round biscuits out of this.

   [51]bc biscuits 11

   I think I baked these just a TAAAD bit too long. I should’ve pulled
   them out about 2 minutes earlier. It’s not over baked or anything, but
   I just don’t like that brown color on top. I love em light golden
   brown. Round, fat, and light golden brown…………. wondering if we’re still
   talking about biscuits? Me too.

   But seriously, these biscuits are AWESOME! Super cheesy flavor, flaky,
   soft, and kinda melts in your mouth. My mom LOVES these. She gets mad
   at me for cooking/baking so much because apparently I’m fattening her
   up lol.

   Buttermilk leftover part 2 coming soon!

[52]Vanilla Cupcakes + Blueberry Buttercream Frosting

   [53]May 14, 2014May 14, 2014 / [54]fbudiman / [55]2 Comments

   I’ve been on a baking frenzy lately. Cookies week after week after
   week, and now I’m blowin up my kitchen with some cupcakes. The thing
   about me and cupcakes is that, I LOVE making them way more than I like
   eating em. So relaxing. And I get to decorate. Of course I eat them (uh
   duUUUH do not even doubt me), but not the way I eat cookies. It’s the
   opposite with cookies. I pop cookie after cookie in my mouth, but
   baking them can be such a pain in the ass. Simple, but a pain
   nonetheless.

   So I was reaaaaally craving some cupcakes (for like a week), and I’ve
   been Yelping cupcakeries up and down my area, and I had to stop myself
   a few billion thousand times, because I should just take that craving
   as an excuse to bake some cupcakes. So here we are darlings.

   Btw yes I’m still on that diet. Not to brag, but I actually lost like 7
   lbs since I started it BAAAAHAHaA HATE ME~

   So the cupcakes. I wanted something simple so I decided on vanilla.
   Geezus talk about simple. But don’t hate on vanilla. Vanilla is like,
   the mother of all flavors. I got the vanilla cupcake recipe from a blog
   called Natasha’s Kitchen, find the recipe [56]here. The rest of the
   blog is also wonderful. I love food blogs.

   I basically stuck to the recipe almost exactly, except I did use
   regular AP flour instead of cake flour. I also used reduced fat
   buttermilk, because stupid ass Pavilions didn’t even have regular fat
   buttermilk. I usually try not to use low fat, reduced fat ANYTHING in
   recipes because it’s just not the same. Wtf dude, I seriously drove to
   2 different Pavilions and found that they only currently carried the
   GIANT ass carton of reduced fat buttermilk. I guess I’m the dumb one
   for not hitting up Ralph’s or something. Not only is that carton
   annoyingly large, I only had to use 1/2 cup of it. So now it sits in my
   fridge and will expire in a week’s time so I gotta use it up. Speaking
   of, I will get back to that after this recipe.

   Eggs, sugar, brrRrrrRrrrrr mix mix mix. Add some oily canola oils and
   continue. OK You know what, I don’t need to narrate. Just look at the
   recipe! Sorry I will post them directly on the blog when it’s
   appropriate, but I really don’t like reposting the same recipes from
   other blogs. Feels like I’m plagiarizing. And it’s less work to just
   link heh. heh. heh.

   [57]vb cupcakes 1 [58]vb cupcakes 2 [59]vb cupcakes 3 [60]vb cupcakes 4
   [61]vb cupcakes 5 [62]vb cupcakes 6

   I accidentally deleted the picture of the cupcakes fresh out of the
   oven. DAMN IT! Oh well. They are really delicious cupcakes. Fluffy and
   not too sweet, and definitely a smoooooth vanilla flavor. Goes well
   with everything. My batch came out to 17 cupcakes. Awkward.

   So I will post the buttercream recipe because I honestly don’t know
   where I got the original from. I guess I kinda winged it. Worked out
   though! I based it off of a strawberry buttercream frosting. This is
   enough to frost about a dozen cupcakes. Maaaaybe a little more. I left
   off a few cupcakes unfrosted because I kinda just like eating plain
   cake sometimes.

   Ingredients:

   - 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (only softened a liiiiittle bit, you
   can’t have mushy melty butter)
   – a little more than 2 cups of powdered sugar
   – a dash of salt
   – around 3 tablespoons pureed blueberries
   – 1/3 teaspoon of vanilla extract

   Ok fine, these ingredients are not exact because I did throw them
   together with an experimental approach. I personally don’t love super
   sugary sweet frosting, so I try to go easy on the powdered sugar
   without making the frosting TOOOO buttery. So whatever works for ya, in
   the end you’re the one eating it lol.

   1. Whip the butter with salt until fluffy. If you have only salted
   butter, obviously forgo the salt and just whip that butta. This is why
   you can’t have it be melty or mushy, because it’s just gonna get
   creamed to death and you will have runny ass frosting. Unless you like
   that. Then by all means.

   2. Add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time. Don’t forget to taste as
   you go, to make sure it’s not overly sweet or anything.

   [63]vb cupcakes 7

   3. Add vanilla extract and blueberry puree and blend well. If it’s too
   runny, then add a little more of powdered sugar. Seriously, not too
   much. I’m not into diabetes.

   [64]vb cupcakes 8

   And that should be it. It really is quite easy. I’m pretty sure I used
   more than just 3 tablespoons of blueberries, it might be closer to 4
   tbsp. Adjust to how you like.

   Oh and I like to top my cupcakes with fresh fruit. I bathed this bowl
   of blueberries in some simple syrup, just so they’re a little bit
   shinier and don’t look like dead ass fruits sitting atop some beautiful
   cakes. Like such. Look at em glistening like they’re hot shit. Ok they
   are.

   [65]vb cupcakes 9

   Then frost your babies! And top with some cute little berries.

   [66]vb cupcakes 10 [67]vb cupcakes 11  [68] vb cupcakes 12

   WOOOHOO! My family LOVES them. My mama especially. There were 17
   cupcakes yesterday, and today there are 4 left. Geezus who has been
   eating them all…. I only ate 2 total. But I’m not complaining.

   OH yeah since I have a shit ton of buttermilk left in my fridge, I am
   going to post another recipe real soon of some mystery item that calls
   for buttermilk……. it’s delicious. That’s all you need to know.

   Good night!

[69]Cookies!!!

   [70]May 3, 2014May 4, 2014 / [71]fbudiman / [72]1 Comment

   So I made three different batches of cookies on three separate
   occasions in the past 2.5 weeks. YES I DID. And each batch equals to
   approximately 50+ cookies. Oh did I mention yet? I’m on a diet? LOL
   DIET HAHAHA that’s a good one… yea well I’m on one okay and it totally
   sucks the happiness out of my life. But I can still MAKE cookies, just
   not eat all of them… my tears make them extra moist and I don’t even
   have to add the salt.

   Summer is coming up. Well, here it’s pretty much summer already
   (kinda). It gets reaaaaaally unbearably HOT, and swimsuits and tank
   tops and short shorts become a way of life. Otherwise, I would be rolls
   all over the place, year round, hiding behind my “chunky sweaters”
   (which is most likely regular sweaters and the chunks is all me). But
   it is what it is, and if I eat my cookies in moderation, it’s totally
   cool. Hopefully.

   I got all three cookie recipes from Mrs. Fields’ cookie book. Actually
   the book is called “Delicious Cookie and Dessert Recipes from the
   kitchen of Mrs. Fields.” That lady rocks. I grew up eating her cookies
   and they have NEVER EVER failed me. Unlike everything else in life,
   ugh.

   [73]cookies

   I’m not gonna post up the recipes on this blog, simply because I don’t
   wanna type it up. I got it from a recipe book so unfortunately, I have
   no links for you. But I’m sure if you look it up, you will find it. It
   IS the internet.

   Speaking of Mrs. Fields, I grew up eating their butter toffee cookies.
   I didn’t even live in the U.S. for the first 8 years of my life, but
   somehow these amazing cookies still reached my belly. But, WHERE HAVE
   THEY GONE??? I think, if I remember correctly, they stopped selling
   them. I remember asking the lady at Mrs. Fields cookie joint at the
   mall for them, and she responded by telling me that they no longer have
   them!!!!!!! Of course, I flipped over all the chairs and tables at the
   mall in a fiery rage, and proceeded to get kicked out by security for
   bothering all other mall patrons. They took my cookies away… how else
   was I supposed to react? Just kidding though, I just left and was very
   sad. This was many, many years ago, so I can’t recall if she means
   they’re gone FOREVER or if it’s just the mall. But I seriously have not
   seen them since then, like anywhere. So…. I’m pretty sure they’re gone
   forever. And this recipe is not even in the book. So. It’s over.

   Cookie #1: Peanut Butter

   Peanut butter is one of my favorite cookies EVER. Of course, a
   prerequisite to liking these would be liking peanut butter, but these
   are BETTER than peanut butter. But essentially, they still absolutely
   taste like peanut butter, so don’t expect some life changing shit. I
   also omitted 1/4 cup of granulated sugar from it to make it juuust a
   little less sweet (which is pretty much nothing since there’s a total
   of 2 1/2 cups of sugar in the recipe – brown & granulated).

   [74]pb cookie 1 [75]pb cookie 2 [76]pb cookie 3  [77] pb cookie 4

   Looky those cute lil balls of love.

   [78]pb cookie 5  [79] pb cookie 6

   Aaaaaand I totally fucked up a small batch LOL. But they still taste
   great and chewy as ever. And really easy to split apart.

   [80]pb cookie 7

   I also made a big peanut butter cookie pie. As you can probably guess,
   I had some awkward amount of dough left, so I just decided to go for it
   and dump them in one big pie pan. Maybe I can slather on some
   strawberry jelly on them? Peanut butter jelly cookie pie???? Hooolyyyy
   shiiit. Or maybe some ice cream? Geezus I can get so creative with a
   cookie.

   Final results below (only 1/3 of the recipe):

   [81]pb cookie 8

   Oh WHY do I bake my cookies in pie pans you ask? For a few reasons.
   One, my cookie sheets were dirty as fuck. They are crusted with some
   nasty ass shit and I just do not even wanna go near that. And second,
   because these dirty cookie sheets actually throw me off my baking time.
   I have NO idea what kind of metal they’re made of, but they always seem
   to burn my cookies before baking time is even up. Third, because we
   have literally a HUNDRED pie pans in our house that just sit there. I
   honestly didn’t know we eat so many pies. I need new cookie sheets. Or
   maybe a silpat since I love to bake so much? I really should invest in
   one.

   Cookie #2: Black and Whites

   Another one of my favorites. Well, let’s just say these are all my
   favorites. This one is a little less sweet, but I still took out
   another 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Perfect.

   What diet?

[94]Foodie from Los Angeles

   [95]April 20, 2014May 1, 2014 / [96]fbudiman / [97]Leave a comment

   So I live in LA……… county. That really means I’m not from the actual
   city of Los Angeles, although I do work there, and it’s much easier to
   tell people I’m from LA because who doesn’t know LA?? Anyway, I spent
   the last 2 days in the ACTUAL CITY of Los Angeles, and there was a lot
   of food involved… so here I am.

   Went on a date with my boyfriend to [98]Lala’s Grill on Friday night,
   which is the place I mentioned in my previous post! Was excited to
   share that place with people, but I clicked my own link and got totally
   suckered by all the pictures myself. I actually got off work at 1 PM
   that day (fuck. yeah. bitches), so I had a good few hours to myself
   while everyone else were still stuck at work (suck. it. bitches) (jk
   about the bitches). So I made some more cookies. YUP, but I still have
   1 more cookie recipe to tackle, so I’m still holding off on posting
   about my cookie baking good time.

   So Lala’s Grill is an Argentinian restaurant, which is actually the
   first and only place that I have tried Argentinian food at (so I can’t
   compare it to anything, and therefore I can safely say it’s the best I
   ever had – cue Drake ~). Believe me, this shit is GOOD. I’ve had some
   MEAT cravings (har har) as of recent, so I’ve been stuffing a bunch of
   different types of meat in my mouth (the heads of pervs all over the
   world are exploding right now). Well ENOUGH TALKING!

   [99]lalas 1  [100] lalas 2

   Oh my heavens. Delicious FREE, crusty bread with a FREE bowl of the
   most delicious and flavorful chimichurri for all of Lala’s customers. I
   literally had to hold myself back from finishing the whole basket of
   bread, because I knew I would get filled up quickly (ha) and wouldn’t
   be able to make a dent in my entree. My bf wanted an appetizer, so we
   ordered the combo – which came with 3 empanadas (chicken, spinach, and
   ham & cheese – our choices), a grilled chorizo sausage, and a potato
   and onion tart (???? Ok I totally forgot what it was called exactly,
   but I think I’m in the ballpark). SHIT!!!! I had to hold myself back
   from inhaling that plate also. That sausage was fucking amazing.

   [101]lalas 3

   My beautiful entree. Entrana al ajo (grilled skirt steak topped with
   garlic & parsley) with a side salad and a delicious mound of some
   GOOOOOD ASSS rice. As you can see I’m out of clever adjectives. But
   really, this picture speaks for itself, so I’m not even gonna. I’m
   getting hungry just looking at this.

   And yesterday I went to BROKECHELLA aka Coachella for all the broke
   folks. It’s a very interesting event, but basically it’s a music and
   arts festival. Personally, it’s not really my scene but it was cool
   nonetheless. And there was also a row of food trucks at the event, so
   I’m not gonna bitch. There was a food truck called [102]Good Greek
   Grub, which I have never heard of until yesterday, but MAN! It is
   legit. My bf ordered the Zeus fries and as you can see, a flock of pigs
   just came around and went to town. JK those are my friends :)

   [103]brokechella 1 [104]brokechella 2

   There was also a tent to promote [105]NKLA (no kill LA), which is an
   organization trying to stop the city of LA from killing animals at
   shelters. At least I think that’s what it is. There were a few dogs
   chillin there to be adopted. AWW look at that one, so wrinkly and so
   cute.

   [106]brokechella 3 [107]brokechella 4 [108]brokechella 5

   And there is my friend with a bunch of naked stickers on his back. We
   are very mature. No doubt about it. Lastly, a #selfie.

   And after Brokechella, we headed over to Little Tokyo (which is a
   clusterfuck of some of the best restaurants I’ve had the pleasure of
   trying) to eat dinner. Everything was kind of crowded so we went to
   [109]Far Bar  to wait, but ended up eating dinner there. It was a good
   decision. My belly thanks me. No wait, my taste buds thank me, but my
   belly is stretched out wide and is really pissed at me. We’re not
   talking right now.

   [110]far bar 1 [111]far bar 2

   Wasabi fries and my ITALIAN SAMURAI burger. Geezus that’s quite a name.
   It’s a grilled, flavorful beef patty, sitting on a bed of lettuce and
   tomato, topped with tempura fried onion rings, parmesan crisp, and
   prosciutto, with a slather of spicy mayo between toasted brioche buns.
   Need I say more???

   Los Angeles may not be the prettiest of cities, in fact I’d say it’s
   definitely NOT a pretty city. But it makes up for it in other ways.
   Most definitely.

   Happy Friday! For me, that either means going out with friends and bf
   to drink, or watch movies, or just sit around and hang out (aka get
   drunk). OR… that means I get a nice night in where I can relax to the
   max. Tonight I opted for the latter and it is goin down in my kitchen.
   I said in my previous post I was gonna bake cookies and blog about
   it….. well I did, yesterday. But I still have plenty of ingredients to
   make more, and I plan on making a LOT more this weekend, so the cookie
   post will wait.

   TONIGHT, however, I was feeling steaky. But I wasn’t feeling fancy
   enough to dress my ass up and hit up Ruth’s Chris. My bf calls it Chris
   Ruth LOL. I’ve tried correcting him time and time again, but to no
   avail. But let’s get real, Ruth’s Chris is a strange name, and it
   doesn’t roll off your tongue the way you want it to. Ruth’S Chris. What
   is up with the possessive noun? RUTH’S?! Who is Chris and why does Ruth
   own him? Or her? Like wtf is that about? O you know what, speaking of
   steakhouses, if you live in LA (or a tourist in LA) and want a
   delicious steak without breaking your bank, you should hit up
   [116]Lala’s Grill.

   Ha yea, I just totally wasted a paragraph talking nonsense. So back to
   my Friday night, I wanted steak and so I decided I would make a nice
   steak dinner for my bf and I. Truth is, I have NEVER made a proper
   steak. I mean yea, when I was in college, I threw some horse shit cut
   of meat on some non stick pan and doused it with who knows what, and
   called it steak. That doesn’t count. So I thought I’d give it a try,
   and looked up some simple recipes and BOOM. Found me one.

   This one had over 500 reviews and averaged out to 5/5 stars, and it
   seemed simple enough. Recipe [117]here by Alton Brown!

   [118]20140411_193539  [119] 20140411_200050

   Some beautiful rib eye steaks just chillin and cooling down to room
   temp. And then they got all oiled up and salted and peppered.

   20140411_202555

   And I made a simple pan sauce with whatever ingredients I
   had lying around. Wish I had wine to reduce it with, but all the wines
   I got at home are wayyyy too fancy to cook with. Ye I’m fancy. Lol
   naaah jk, got several bottles as gifts and it just seems insulting to
   use gift wines to cook with.

   So after the steaks were done, there was a LOT of leftover flavor goin
   on in that skillet, so I sautéed some chopped shallots and garlic, then
   dumped some beef stock and reduced that bitch. Finished with a pat of
   butter.

   [120]20140411_202227  [121] 20140411_203000 [122]20140411_202953

   And there it is. SO JUICY! These pictures are pre-sauced because I
   couldn’t wait to take anymore pics. We wuz hungryyyy.

   But overall, this is a GREAT recipe to use, especially if you don’t
   have a grill. Also, a lot of people had problems with their fire alarms
   going off, because this recipe = hot as balls = lots of smoke. Wasn’t a
   problem with me, but I did take some precautions and covered up my
   smoke detector, opened up my kitchen windows, and turned on my exhaust
   fans. Just a heads up.

   Now I’m super full and satisfied and ready to watch Scandal until I
   pass the fuck out. Good night!

   [124]April 11, 2014April 12, 2014 / [125]fbudiman / [126]1 Comment

   This is actually my second attempt at a food blog. My first one…….
   well, it died. I shared that beloved blog (www.budikang.tumblr.com)
   with one of my closest and equally fat (on the inside) friend Vicky,
   who moved away to Chicago for med school. So basically she’s over there
   doin big things and becoming a doctor while I stay here and get fat all
   by my lonesome. And while that blog has stopped being functional months
   before she even moved away, it just doesn’t seem right to keep posting
   on without her. But that blog was kind of D.O.A anyway… Therefore this
   blog was born. It’s like the older sister has moved on with her life
   and as a parent I’m just super lonely……. so I made another baby. It’s
   just life.

   So basically this is a food blog. YAWWwWwwwn another food blog by
   another fatty… I know I’m sorry. I dunno what else to do with all these
   food thoughts swimming around in my brain, so it’s only natural that I
   get me an outlet right? Ta daaa.

   I’ll be bloggin about food and baking and cooking and eating… and
   whatever else I feel is worthy of this blog. I will try to keep it
   food-related only, because duh. But I get side tracked sometimes so you
   may see some pictures of my dogs here and there… they’re cute though,
   so it shouldn’t be a problem.

   There will be profanity. Maybe tiny droplets of inappropriate comments
   and maaaybe some sexual innuendos. Definitely some sarcasm coming your
   way. And lots of beautiful, drool inducing pictures. Just take it for
   what it is. This blog is not run by Alton Brown. Not saying anything
   bad though because that guy is the tits.

   I plan on baking a shit ton of cookies soon (there’s that profanity I
   promised you), proooobably this weekend (I also said that last weekend
   so we shall see). And you can bet your cute lil booty I will post about
   it.

   I leave thee with a pic of a pizza that I consumed today.

   Til then.

Return of the Soap Opera... minus the soap!

   C'mon P&G, you started the whole soap opera thing... you're missing the
   boat on this one.

   There are a number of regressive developments which harken back to a
   charming time in television history... when a single sponsor underwrote
   an entire show. ([4]Texaco Star Theatre anyone?)

   Well, the model appears to be making a comeback. Here a few examples
   that have popped up recently:

   1. Budweiser [5]sponsors JibJab
   A little birdy told me that the King of Beers is actually sponsoring
   the entirety of JibJab's output, though the visible sponsorship is tied
   to the "official download area of Real Men of Genius" tv spots. The
   humor of these spots is particularly in line with JibJab humor, so that
   works.

   What's boggles the mind is how political JibJab is... does Uncle Bud
   ever call up and ask the boys to kindly remove an offensive cartoon, or
   is their overall sponsorship hidden and made to appear only alive in
   the official BUD area. Hmmm. If anyone has any insight on this... drop
   us a line.

   2. Snapple [6]buys entire ad inventory for 6 weeks at a couple of New
   England Radio Stations.
   Dubbed "Brandcasting" Snapple's move allows them complete control over
   the message and presumably the content. Hey if you have the money and
   want to spend it this way, why not. I'm just not sure as a content
   provider, having a single sugar daddy is such a great thing... at least
   from an artistic integrity point of view... but then look at TV these
   days... integrity! HAH!

   [newbill-3.jpg] 3. Bill Mahr's new [7]AMAZON TV SHOW!!! (No really!)
   This is the purest form of the form. Much like brandcasting pioneer
   [8]BMW Films of ancient (circa 2000 A.D.) Web Days (BTW, you can
   no-longer download the films... WHAT ARE THEY THINKING??? Don't they
   realize there are sites like [9]THIS out there?)

   Will the Maher/Bezos power-duo find a balance between infommercial,
   ABC-style "you're fired" censorship and HBO's cuss-all-you-want,
   screw-the-networks attitude? My instinct is that it will pretend to be
   the latter, but play more like a "set it and forget it" half hour. Damn
   that chicken is juicy!

   Will artists like Maher keep taking these deals if it DOESN'T allow
   them to speak their mind? Probably... they'll justify it as "shooting a
   commercial." It doesn't have to be good, or art... But then if it
   sucks, who's going to watch? We understand stars need to pay the bills,
   but these "shows" have a real opportunity to ruin a... REAL
   OPPORTUNITY!

   Keep watching this space... first products in your movies, now movies
   in your products. WHEN WILL THE MADNESS END?????

Major "Huh?"

   Have a look at the second story in today's
   [12]Adweek/IQ Briefing
   entitled "Marketers Wary of Emerging Media"

   Can I get a big ole collective "huh?" from the audience. Now how 'bout
   some groans.

   Thanks for playing.

   Here's a new thought (said from atop a soapbox constructed entirely of
   PDAs and hospital-thin cellphones): perhaps it should be a corporate
   obligation to embrace emerging media (if only to demonstrate to our
   consumers that we are willing to look at new ways of communicating and
   playing with them.

   And while we're at it, why is "emerging media" only talked about from a
   digital perspective.
   Perhaps a branded urinal cake (with appropriate messaging, of course)
   will be as surprising and delightful to the targeted consumer as seeing
   their favorite brand reduced to pixels.

   C'mon marketers. Jump in. (or at least toe in)
   Try it. You'll like it. And so will your consumers.

Airing their dirty laundry... the right way!

   [brfs052406allbus.jpg]
   Unilever's ALL brand teamed up with Alcone Marketing Group to roll out
   their duds wrapped around a NYC bus with "[15]Spot the Bus"
   sweepstakes. The campagin used consumers cell phones to record the bus'
   location and enter them into the sweeps.

   An exciting promotion all in all, assuming you are standing upwind of
   the vehicle!

Rolling Billboards, for cats!

   [rc_cars_billboards.jpg] Here's the ultimate job: Drive an RC car
   around a mall all day and get paid for it! Soon to be in the classified
   near you! Check out this post from the AdGang at MIT on mini-rolling
   Billborads. With MIT's swarmbot technology, imagine little herds of
   free roaming ad clusters. My inner media buyer is getting very
   confused.

Team buying in China... let's play here!

   [p4a.jpg] Interesting article in the Christian Science Monitor points
   out a trend called [22]Team Buying where groups meet online, fan out to
   a bunch of stores, find the best looking place, then flash mob/descend
   on the joint to negotiate a "Group Discount"

   Hey if big corps get group discounts, why not flash mobs... they're
   there, with cash and ready to buy... what are you going to do shun
   them?

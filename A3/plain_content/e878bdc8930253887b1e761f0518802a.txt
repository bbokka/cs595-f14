   [71][Destroyed-insurgents-improvised-Anti-Aircraft-RPG-vehicles-%281%29
   .jpg]
   Last week, Boko Haram men took over four towns in Borno and Yobe states
   after a gun battle with  military men guarding the areas.The four towns
   they seized are; Gwoza in Borno state and Buni Yadi, Buni Gari and
   Goniri, all in Gujba local government area of Yobe State.
   Not only did they overwhelm the Nigerian soldiers deployed to guard the
   towns, they also killed at least 100 residents, including the brother
   of Emir of Gwosa and the chief Imam of Gwoza's major Mosque.
   Continue...
   A top security source told Sahara Reporters that Boko Haram had
   successfully beaten back three separate columns of Nigerian troops from
   Gwoza. “The most recent was a team of soldiers led by Lieutenant
   Colonel Agwu of the former Special Operations Battalion (SOB) now 234
   Battalion,” the source said.
   Security sources also disclosed that the sect killed or wounded
   numerous Nigerian soldiers during their initial assault and, days
   later, in a counter-offensive mounted by the Nigerian Army to try to
   wrest the town back from the stranglehold of the Islamists.
   The militants are now said to be occupying camps abandoned by soldier
   after they fled from a series of fierce battles Boko Haram.

   Boko Haram also bombed Katako Bridge that links Buni Yadi with
   Damaturu, the Yobe State capital.
   The Nigerian army are said to be planning to retake the four towns.

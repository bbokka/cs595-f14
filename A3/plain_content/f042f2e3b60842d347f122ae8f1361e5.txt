   scarred and scarred
   fire moving through charred stiff senses
   pushing a muscle a minute in the furnace till a full fist clenches.
   then its up in the air…
   so let the skies cry for relevance..
   hell’s been breeding a hell breathing recalcitrant
   faceless scheming inhabitant, the pen wielding militant..
   loner lycan with a hell of an appetite..
   his back on the burning floors, forced to face the heavens..
   half living the moment,  clueless what the time is..
   But of course I get the best perspective..
   from whatever skirts conceal to the weakest defences..
   I see everything and everything else..
   and its all mine.. everything..

   its all art, i tell you..
   lines get drawn followed by strokes, their themes might scare you..
   realism depicted as we are driven tho most of us only see from the rear
   view..
   passion capturing our crimes..their stereotypes are designs.. our
   struggles are hidden signs and they end up in curfews..
   Power and money is absinthe.. our suffering is towering in reverse, the
   pressure keeps rising..
   disheartening
   frustration is enough motivation to raise arms..and ask questions
   Or conform and start serving..
   the bigger picture is confusing, these elements are elusive
   conflicting images of religion against the greedy
   bt religion is a strobe light and latter will dance to any rythm..
   or is it between power and the needy ?
   we beneath, rebel into degenerate forms, bleeding to live..ready to
   leave for a reason..
   but these are classic times.. trying our best to ride on positive
   vibes.. with a boatload of perspective, salvaging the lesson of every
   tide

[23]fate or destiny

   fate.. Or destiny ?
   whats the end going to sound like for this jaded entity ?
   do i slave for the heavens or side with the gambler.. and make mother
   nature a frenemy?
   forever lost.. like wandering in space in search of eternity..
   time is two faced.. watched as my mind flew away, raced till it
   ran out of inspiration..
   now i’m searching for all three in the strangest places..
   more wrong turnings accelerating my descent..my depression,
   though we learn from the fakest faces..
   rock bottom bt i’m never based, plus i hate the basic..
   On that very road Relativity meets the Low End Theory..
   now its confusion from contradictions between
   reality, teachings and what i’m supposed to be thinking.. and this is
   the same brain i’m supposed to use for decisions..
   I’m sinking…
   the depth of stress is a Mad-house…
   I Kip regrets in the background-till i’m alone with my demons..

   corner tight.. back wrestling the wall, sweat drippin.. sweat pounding
   the floor..
   hearts awoken.. Hearts screaming-
   beats increasing by the second, everything steaming at a hundred
   degrees..
   and all this is happening Live, no replays, just foreplay, no repeats..
   but time freezes so speed is also missing..
   believe me, I tried to resist this..
   but She insisted.. my crotch in her grip..
   she’s all wired up when i speak.. mother nature is on the other end of
   the line..
   i move with my eyes..
   she seizes my mind..
   the height of emotions, let hell describe the temparature rise
   ..too soon i’m slipping and sliding in..
   forgetting where the line should be..
   all efforts to stick to the point, even as the tip be running sheet..
   seeds spill when i’m going deep, no fishing for leaves..
   and to think i found her by accident.. back when i was
   searching for myself..
   my worth..
   now she beatin the rythm out of me,
   her kicks keep me pushin in..
   she comes then shes gone again..
   spreading her essence like pollen grains….
   re-igniting my passion for living, steady pushing my talent into
   meaning..
   everything i seek even if she has always been with me..within me
   i live free and i breathe her..
   and she’ll force me to speak it..
   thats just who she is..

   EVERYDOG

   Article written by volunteer Debra Lockhart

   I’ve been volunteering with a local rescue for about a year now and
   have loved every minute of it. In the past year, I’ve transported dogs,
   helped rescue dogs off of a chain, helped a dog give birth, adopted and
   said goodbye as some of my favorites have found their forever home.
   I’ve gotten to know some dogs more than others and have cheered nearly
   every adoption and only shed a tear or two for a few who have
   especially touched me in some way.

   Still, there was something missing. This rescue is foster based, and at
   this time that is the one thing I’m not able to do, so most of my
   interactions come from adoption events or transport services. If I
   could bring my dog to work with me things might be different, because
   sometimes you just need to hug a dog or play with a kitty, so I began
   volunteering at our local SPCA. I figured that they were located close
   enough to my office that I could spend a lunch hour or two each week
   relaxing in the company of a furry little friend under the guise of
   helping them while in all actuality, reaping the benefits that come
   with cuddling a pet. Orientation was in two parts so after part one, I
   was able to ‘socialize with cats’ and I spent a good portion of a lunch
   hour on the floor of a kitty room getting and giving some soft purr-y
   love.

   Part two allowed us to interact with the dogs and there was a special
   boy whom I met at both orientations and I was eager to go back and
   really interact with him on my first “dog day.” Its funny how a dog (or
   any animal, really) can grab your heartstrings and how it varies from
   person to person as to who that special furry pal may be. A fellow
   volunteer nudged me and pointed at a dog, “That’s my dog. I’m going to
   adopt that one.” “Hmmm, cute dog, nothing special,” I thought. He or
   she was the kind of dog I might not have given a second glance at if I
   weren’t here to generally socialize with the dogs.

   In the kennel next to “her dog” was the special someone who had me at
   first glance. Truth be told, “special boy” is not usually someone who
   would grab my attention… except he did. He was just a medium sized dog,
   medium hair, medium build but with a deep chest and funny white paws
   that were too big for his body. (As a further testament to how
   perception skews what we actually see, he is listed as a large dog with
   long hair.) There was nothing exceptional… but his eyes. Ah, those
   soulful cinnamon eyes peering at me over the chew toy he hopefully
   offered me, they had me at hello.

[6]SPRING GARDEN VS FALL GARDEN

   [7][garden%2B017.JPG] It doesn't really matter what time of year it is
   I always get the gardening bug.  I count the days until I can plant the
   first seedling of Spring.  I keep the Spring garden going through
   the scorching temperatures of Summer until Fall when it will again
   begin to thrive.  I move my container plants inside during Winter until
   I can put them back outdoors in the early Spring.  So it goes.  My
   Round Robin of the gardening bug.
   Which season is easiest to grown the best crops?  The only honest
   answer to that question is-it depends on what part of the country you
   plant your garden in.  Where I live temperatures over 100 in the summer
   are common.  The warmer season holds on longer than many other
   climates.  The coldest part of the year is shorter with fewer days
   below freezing.  If you live, say in the Northern part of the US, you
   might have a shorter Summer season and longer Winter season. I adjust
   my routine accordingly.

   In the Spring I plant my tomatoes, green beans, peas and peppers
   earlier than some may in other areas of the country.  They also tend to
   fizzle out sooner as the hot weather comes on quickly and seems to last
   forever.  I don't give up the garden though.  I still keep my
   crops watered and check on them every day removing as much of the dead
   foliage as possible.  While Summer winds down the blossoms on these
   plants will again peak out of the stems and I soon have a whole new set
   of crops.
   [9][Container%2BPepper.jpg]
   [10][upsidedown-tomato.jpg] [11][Squash%2BLeaves.jpg] In addition to
   the revival of my Spring vegetation I do blend in my favorite cooler
   weather sprouts such as broccoli and kale.  Some are placed in
   containers, typically a 5 gallon lard bucket with holes drilled in the
   bottom, so they can continue to prosper in the bright lights of my bay
   window during Winter.  Others work better in the inverted container,
   which will hang securely above the same bay window.  It's like having
   my own mini garden right indoors.
    Where I reside there is little doubt in my mind that my Fall garden
   thrives much better than the Spring garden. I attribute my more
   productive Fall garden to timing, determination and Mother Nature.  If
   I know the climate best suited to my crops than I know when to best
   plan for my garden.  For example green beans, tomatoes and peppers
   will thrive in Spring and Fall.  If I care for the Spring plants they
   will succeed with more vegetables in Fall.  The harvest will also be
   much greater. Why? Because the plants are already mature.  There is now
   waiting for seedling to grow and yield results.  Once the weather
   begins to cool off the blossoms will appear in abundance and fresh
   crops soon follow.
   The Spring and Fall garden can both be gratifying.  One of the most
   important tools you will have for success is proper planning.  Know the
   environment best suited for your crops, and know the climate you will
   be harvesting in.

[23]WILL YOU BATTLE THE YUCCA

   [24][Garden%2B005.JPG]
   Giant Yucca
   I have several Yucca in my yard.  Some were rescued from a demolished
   apartment complex.  Some were swiped  from the side of a road in
   Oklahoma.  I have several different varieties.  The "Giant Yucca" is
   quite possibly my favorite.  It stand majestic in the spring with it's
   elegant white flowers reaching for the heaven's.  It has strong, thick
   leaves that are sturdy and hold up to a lot, including the colder
   temperatures.  It has sharp pointed leaves that can be quite painful
   ﻿
   [25][garden%2B014.JPG]
   Adan's Needle
   The Adam's Needle has much thinner needle like leaves that grow outward
   more than upward.  They do not achieve nearly the size of the Giant
   Yucca and are much more delicate.  They also have beautiful, majestic
   white flowers that grace the cool spring weather with there presence.
   Native American used almost every part of the yucca plant for
   everything from weaving to mastering ritual concoctions.  Little is
   actually know about the benefits, or dangers of the yucca plant.  One
   thing I do know first hand is that you can't battle one.  No matter how
   hard you try to remain protected the yucca is more powerful than any
   planning and preparation on your part.
   [26][Halticotoma-valida1-yucca-bug-web-title%5B1%5D.jpg] I am very
   proud of my Yucca's.  It took some work to transport them from the
   original dwelling and nurture them to the appealing landscape they
   became.  Low and behold I noticed my favorite Yucca was beginning to
   look extremely droopy.  At closer glance I realized my worst fear.
   There they were scurrying all over my succulent like they had always
   been there.  These little creatures (commonly referred to as Yucca
   Bugs) thrive by draining the yucca of all the vital fluid in it's
   leaves.  They are merciless and can destroy an entire plant before you
   may even realize you've been hit.
   Fortunately I was able to take preventative measures at the right
   time.  Armed with a 3 cup spray bottle full of canola oil and shampoo
   the entire plant was sprayed top to bottom and underneath.  The spray
   lands on the tiny bugs and literally suffocates them beyond survival
   without doing any harm to the Yucca.
   With the first round of treatment complete all I could do is wait a few
   days.  Another good coating of prevention was added to be sure nothing
   was missed. Like most tiny infectious creatures it doesn't take
   long for these destructive mites to reproduce, even if only a few are
   left behind.
   Once I was sure I had removed the infestation the daunting task of
   removing the destroyed foliage began. Armed with gloves, long sleeves
   and slacks I concentrated on cuttin off the dead leaves starting at the
   bottom.  It wasn't long before I began to see that my yucca was going
   to survive just fine.  There was even plenty of new growth sprouting
   from the ground underneath the destroyed leaves.
   [27][thCAIA92AW.jpg] It wasn't until I removed my gloves and shirt that
   I became concerned.  Even through the protective clothing the sharp
   needlepoint leaves left my arms looking as if I had developed a
   terrible rash.  It wasn't pretty and yes it became irritating.  The
   tiny pricks were on my legs and event on the top of my feet.  After
   some research I learned that with proper care (to avoid infection) my
   predicament was not as severe as it appeared.  Plenty of anti-itch
   cream and good cleaning prevented any real harm.  The best part is that
   my yucca not only survived but grew even larger once it was trimmed
   back.  Maybe this was just mother natures way of saying my yucca need
   some serious attention.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

[39]IS WORKING FROM HOME FOR YOU

   [40][post4%5B1%5D.jpg]
   In today's economy I knew I needed to find a way to earn extra income.
   The ads are spread all over the internet and TV. Banners claiming you
   can earn $15-$75 per hour working from home. After weeks of researching
   I was able to find some possibilities that work, and several to avoid.
   When I recently lost my employment making money from home became a
   necessity.
   Not all work at home opportunities are scams. Locating the right fit is
   a challenge that will take effort. The reasons for home employment are
   growing. It doesn't matter if you need to spend more time with your
   children, save traveling expenses or just want to be your own boss.
   There are many places on the internet that will give you the right
   direction to find what is best for your needs.
   First step is to make a plan. What is it you like to do? What keeps you
   motivated to work every day? If you need suggestions these two websites
   have ideas and guidance that will not cost you. My focus is here
   because these are a "one stop" shop of information.
   [41][randimg%5B2%5D.jpg]
   Work at Home Mom has a website at [42]http://www.wahm.com/. Positions
   are updated daily and filtered by location. Careers promoted on this
   site are not only available to moms. They are available to any
   qualified applicant. Job search and stay at home articles are also
   featured. Always be sure to check out any opportunity before you apply
   for a stay at home job.
   Another useful website to visit is Work at Home Careers found at
   [43]http://www.workathomecareers.com. From survey taking, to writing,
   to administrative assistant; it is your option to be as creative as
   possible. The promotional articles contributed on Work at Home Careers
   offer great insight into the job search. You will also have the ability
   to upload our resume giving employers an opportunity to seek out your
   qualifications.
   Once you have done some research and accepted an opportunity hit the
   task head on. The sooner you grasp the routine the quicker you will
   begin to obtain an income. You may choose something in the line of
   customer service which requires specific hours dedicated to addressing
   customer concerns. You will work on your own with a boss who will set a
   quota of output. It can be a relaxed atmosphere in an environment you
   are comfortable with. However, a higher degree of concentration and
   discipline will be required. Some employers will pay only by the amount
   of issues you address so you must be able to focus on the requirements
   and remain undistracted.
   In the world of internet and computers there are an enormous number of
   professions available to do from home. Regardless of your computer
   usage occasions are available to earn from home. Accounting, Medical
   Billing and Virtual Assistants are more in demand to keep up with the
   growing small business industry. Some beginning opportunities will
   offer free train programs that outline basic computer skills. There is
   a demand for employees who have recent experience with on-line
   bookkeeping programs. Completing and transmitting accounting tasks
   electronically has become a more economical way for employers to
   maintain employees.
   Be cautious who you deal with when looking for work at home. The most
   important tool is research. Never respond to an offer that requires you
   to pay an upfront cost to either job search or become employed. If
   something sounds too good to be true it's probably not. Working at home
   can be relaxing, casual, less stress and less expense. However, you
   must be committed to succeed. You must be positive that you are ready
   and willing to meet the requirements of working at home. If you are
   truly enthusiastic and stay on goal you can be surprised and rewarded.

Totally Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies

   Every once in a while life tosses you an amazing surprise. I love
   baking fresh cookies and like a lot of people chocolate chicp loaded
   with plenty of walnuts is definately my favorite. This year I took a
   chance and wanted to see if there is any way to make a vegan cookie.
   These cookies are so soft and chewey you can't stop eating them! The
   biggest die hard cookie fan won't even realize that this sweet treat is
   totally vegan.
   2 1/2 cups flour
   1 small bannana (mashed)
   1/2 cup Earth Balance butter
   1/2 cup packed brown sugar
   1/4 cup soy milk
   1 tsp salt
   1 tsp vanilla
   1 1/2 cups Sunspire 42% Cacao
   1/2 cup chopped walnuts
   Preheat oven to 375. Mix flour, mashed bananna and butter in large
   bowl. Blend together with fork or pasty cutter until no clumps of
   butter are visible. Add brown sugar, milk salt and vanilla and continue
   to mix until dough is moist and well blended. Add chips and walnuts
   stirring well to distribute chips evenly into batter. Coat cookie sheet
   with a vegetable oil cooking spray. Drop cookies by spoon on to pan at
   least 1 1/2 inches and bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown and
   slightly moist in the center. Makes approximately 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

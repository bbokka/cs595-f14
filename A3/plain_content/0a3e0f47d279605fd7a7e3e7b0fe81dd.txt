   He signs as 'Kris凡' only once, in June. The new ones signatures that
   you can see on twitter aren't actually new. And recently he signs as
   '凡凡'. Like I said, it's not about the name, it's about what you
   appreciate more - the past or current reality. As far as I see, you
   prefer him in the past.
   I call him Krease too. If I bring out BenBen and Koala too what would
   it mean I prefer? Of course the name doesn't matter but it doesn't
   fuckin matter which name I call him or which he wants to be called or
   sign with BECAUSE HE'S ALL OF IT. From what /I/ see, you're way too
   calculative.
   If I see you again I swear I'll throw an alpaca at your face. Don't
   risk it.

   'WYF has only been around for 4 months' - HUH? Sorry but he IS Wu Yifan
   more and before than 'Kris' (staged name, btw) It's his name given him
   by his mother so I'm pretty sure it's more important to him than
   fangirls preferences. It's not about the name I guess: 'WYF will always
   be here', he said.
   I put that sentence with WYF in quotation marks for a reason to
   differentiate my point with him in EXO and now with the time of 2 years
   and 4 months. """WYF""". The WYF that we now call him as Wu Yifan even
   though he still signs Kris in his autographs. The WYF after he left EXO
   which we refer to him as WYF instead of Kris and the WYF he is going to
   be called for his new direction in the acting business. WYF and Kris is
   the same person but has slightly different personas.

   you're lying to yourself - you still like exo's kris more which doesn't
   exists anymore and the amount of "otps" gifs you're posting everyday
   show it. all shippers acting like that. this is understandable because
   you're "neutral" about exo and wyf and still support both sides, your
   choice.
   You can believe what you want but I won't get my shoes dirty because of
   you. Before I gained a surplus amount of 700-800 followers in the span
   of literally 4 months, I was still on WYF's side with no one affecting
   how I think and that still goes. NO ONE influences what I believe or
   think and I obviously am aware of who I'm stanning and have nothing to
   hide.
   You're really biased in your thinking if you think that I like EXO's
   Kris more than WYF just because I post OTP gifs. """EXO's Kris""" has
   been around for over 2 years and """WYF""" has only been around for 4
   months. So which aspect of him has more material for me to post and
   talk about? Where have I spent time longer? Obviously his time in EXO.
   There is nothing wrong with me posting OTPs if I obviously ship it and
   that is a separate case with me liking Kris with the members and me
   liking Kris by himself as an individual BUT IM STILL ALLOWED TO PUT
   THEM TOGETHER. I don't know why some Kris stans are so eager to
   separate him from the people he used to be around and make him a
   completely new person. He has history. EXO and their fans may choose to
   do the whole 이제는 시작이야 bullshit, but I'm not and neither are the other
   Kris stans who feel the same way.
   DO NOT tell me that I'm lying to myself. I wouldn't put Kris back into
   EXO even if I had the power to. I still love EXO but Kris is my first
   and all.

   it seems like you liked exo's kris more than current wu yifan because
   you're always reminiscent about his past as sm slave.
   As there is no difference between EXO's Kris and the current Wu Yifan,
   I don't know how I can like one more than the other and I tweet so much
   on how much I am relieved he's out of SM and the benefits we get to
   have because he's no longer an SM slave. I reminisce because the past
   him is the present him and the present him came from the past him.

   What if wyf has a girlfriend
   I would be shocked for 10 seconds and 10 seconds only where I would be
   shocked because its new to my ears, but not foreign because its normal
   to prepare myself before it happens coughmaturefangirlingcough. If he
   had a girlfriend, I would be happy for him. I'd seriously be happy and
   jump on my bed for him. Because if that's what he wants and if that's
   what makes him happy, I have no objections. I would even promote them.

   I don't think Kris was that unattractive, if you're talking about group
   shot with SNSD and 2PM members. For me it doesn't look like Kris at all
   (more like B1A4 member) - not only his face/hair, but the way of
   posing, facial expression, etc. Also I don't remember him to be that
   close to these groups.
   I understand your grain of salt.
   But a part of me thinks you don't know what you're talking about
   because where did you get 2pm member/s/ from. Its only Siwon in that
   picture.

   my friends and I hv been arguing bout this, but do u think kris has
   abs? xDDD despite he looked good in white shirt and the shirt just
   sorta fit and showing off his *yummy* body shape but I cant nvr agree
   he has abs or even trying to hv them tho he's one athletic person! xDDD
   LMFAOOOOO LET ME JOIN THE ARGUMENT. I think he has a little fat on his
   body along with the strong angular build that his body has since he's
   not a body builder and he is sportive. But I think he does have some
   "bumpy mold" that represents "abs" even if it might not be chocolate
   abs or an 8 pack. He probably has a nicer chest xDD
   [45]9 days ago
   Lol,why did you keep posting wrong pics:
   [46]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ByRwAj0IYAAvgPs.jpg - this is also NOT
   Kris! It was that time when his false pics circulated on tumblr - just
   guys who were similar to him and fans made if for joke. I'm sure for
   both pics (on the street and this one) it's not him.
   But I think it's Kris so how do I say it is Kris with confidence even
   if I might be wrong.
   [47]9 days ago
   In your opinion do you think kris is seeing someone right now? Or being
   in a relationship?
   In my opinion, nope. He's so focused on work and his fans right now I
   don't think being in a relationship is a priority or even a thought.
   Probably like 4 years later when he's finally settled down and made
   accomplished all his goals that he'll feel comfortable with himself to
   date/get married.

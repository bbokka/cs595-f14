[14]She Says

   [16]IMG_1649


   In that brave new world

   we dare to dream about

   you and I will have

   interchangeable names


   Your red hair will rule over

   dominions mapped out

   with the brown of my skin

   We will dissolve together

   into purest ocher

   darker than this earth

   will care to remember

[20]Your Secret Sober Heart

   By [21]thebee

     [22]IMG_1665


     Bartenders give back your tips: “Cab fare, buddy,” they say and you

     would like for them to mean it but your secret sober heart knows,

     it knows that really, they’re just scared your luck

     would slide off the greasy bill and take on life as an infection,

     the bastards are quick to wipe down the counters in your wake.

[33]You’ve become a thing

“ you’ve become a thing whose only threat is

the flesh that promises sourness

the pit filled with the intent to choke.

(I told you so) ”

[42]PS Marks The Spot

   By [43]thebee

   [44]DSCF0165


   There is a bit of a lull at the end of the day, and she sits and
   writes.

   PS: The grass is mowed, front and back yards are done. Laundry is off
   the line and put away. Trees are trimmed, trash all gone. Kids are fed
   and taking a nap on this cold, rainy day. I am the man, the woman, the
   whoever — and I rock this life.

   The key is under that big brown rock by the gate, the one you struggle
   to move. Get to it.

[62]That Girl On The Wall

   There was this girl up on the wall, and they were drinking to her.
   Cheers, toasts, salut, and all that. I wanted to be that girl.

[72]Afternoon Delight (Food Porn)

   By [73]thebee
   [74]spareribs that I actually cooked

   spareribs that I actually cooked


   An afternoon nap led to a strange dream. I was in someone’s house,
   cooking spicy spareribs. I’ve never been in that kitchen before, but I
   seemed familiar with it, it looked like a combination of all the
   kitchens in all the houses I’ve lived in through the years.

   The spareribs were done, and I was sitting on the counter with the
   laptop typing away, when my ex suddenly came in. Don’t ask which ex,
   I’m not telling. He went straight to the pan of spareribs on the stove,
   lifting the lid and sniffing with his eyes closed. Then he turns to me
   and says’ “Why are you not sharing this with me?” I was silent. He
   glares at me, then pouts. He goes to the counter, takes out a plate and
   a fork and helps himself to the spareribs. In between bites he keeps
   muttering, “It’s so good, so good!”

   This is when I woke up from the dream, disoriented to find myself in
   bed instead of the kitchen. It felt strangely erotic. And now I am
   hungry.

[83]The Secret to Invisibility

   By [84]thebee

   One way to be lost is to back pedal
   over tracks. Reverse step into each footprint,
   match heel and toe exactly so you become
   invisible, erased as cleanly as
   that puff of breath exhaled into fog.

   Another way, much more subtle
   but just as easy, is to insert oneself into crowds.
   Follow the pace of the horde, shuffle quietly
   shoulder to shoulder, sidle in sideways
   and become absolutely hidden.

   This is the true double-cross.
   We are so alike we render ourselves translucent,
   float like tiny fish under the current,
   become white noise, indistinguishable
   from the rest of the confusion.

   The real secret to disappearing though,
   is to live out in the open, back to the sun –
   faceless, and acquiescing. The camouflage
   of so many single weeds blanketing an empty lot,
   verdant, sweeping, and ultimately, unseen.

[88]Wander on: Airport Secrets

   By [89]thebee


   [90]picture-pretty window, Siem Reap airport, Cambodia

   Picture-pretty window at Siem Reap airport, Cambodia


   Every three months or so, it never fails, I end up in an airport
   somewhere with hours to kill until the next flight. I have mastered the
   many rituals of the plane passenger, for instance, how to get to your
   gate at just the right moment so you don’t have to wait too long to
   board. I’ve killed time at bars, coffee shops, souvenir stalls,
   bookshops, massage spas. There is a little secret to it, you need to
   remember your alcohol and credit card limit, else there will be missed
   flights and a whole mess of trouble ahead.

   From traveling so often, I have collected quite a few insider tips.
   These little airport secrets are good things to keep in mind. I’ve
   learned firsthand to avoid the cheaper route through Delhi because I
   know how they detain passengers in that dead end side of the airport
   until it’s closer to their departure time, no matter how long the
   layover is. You’re stuck in an empty hallway for hours, no shops, no
   bars, just a broken vendo machine in the corner. In Singapore, I’ve
   found a corner where they have these ergonomic lounge chairs that you
   can lie down in and sleep undisturbed, amid lush greenery.  In
   Cambodia, the prettiest spot at the airport to do a selfie are any
   of those picture windows that look out the gardens. My frequent hub,
   expensive Dubai airport harbors a twilight zone where you can get free
   wi-fi, it’s near gate C17. Liquids, gels, and waxes are frowned upon at
   London Heathrow, and anything that overflows a little baggie will have
   to go into the trash. They don’t care if it’s your special $300 face
   cream, into the bin it goes. Also, most of the security personnel at
   this airport are notoriously rude, for no fathomable reason.
   At Chicago’s Midway I learned that if you rub your fingers on your
   forehead you will have an easier time getting your fingerprints
   scanned. The oil makes your prints more visible to the machine, or so
   the immigration officer tells me, smiling at my horrified expression
   upon realizing that my face is oily.

   Guys, avoid being profiled at LAX in Los Angeles by shaving off, or at
   least neatly trimming, your beard. A friend and I arrived at this
   conclusion after he was detained and interviewed for close to an hour
   in a small room, his suitcases turned upside down, his credentials
   scrutinized to the last detail. Next time he passes thru clean-shaven,
   nothing happens. At Kathmandu airport, any and all knives found in your
   carry on (why would you have a knife there to begin with) will be
   confiscated and dumped into a little wicker basket. They let lighters
   go through, but the knives, they take. In Kuala Lumpur, there’s a roast
   duck that tastes as fantastic as it looks, and if you eat only one
   thing at this airport, that duck is it. In Manila, walk briskly past
   the old guys in shirt jacks who smile sweetly and ask if you need help
   with your luggage. Yes, they may look like everyone’s favorite uncle,
   but ten times out of ten, they will rip you off. At Japan’s Narita
   airport, identical looking women in knee socks will direct you to your
   gate, whisk you briskly through scanners and go through your carry
   on with ruthless efficiency. You will look on quietly and let them.

   And lastly, at Kabul airport — should you have the misfortune of
   finding yourself there — if you are a woman, X-ray scans are easier
   when you ‘accidentally’ show the female security person photos of your
   children. She will blabber at you in rapid Pashto or Dari and nod and
   smile endlessly, but no matter. Suddenly, the scan will be forgotten,
   and you will be waved through as though you paid dearly for secret
   passage.

[100]Dubai Night Drive with Little Omar

   By [101]thebee
   [102]burj-at-night

   [103]http://azeemazeez.com/photos/burj-khalifa-at-night/

   Yesterday evening, I shared a hotel limo with a Palestinian woman and
   her 7 year old son, Omar. There were no taxis available at the hotel
   that night because it was Iftar, when the Muslims break the day long
   fast, and everyone was busy feasting.

   The lady said she and her son were passing thru Dubai from a trip to
   Palestine, on their way back home to California. She was dressed in an
   abaya, but her face was not covered, only her hair. Her son was dressed
   in western clothes, and spoke only English, as far as I could tell. We
   got to talking in the hotel lobby after she asked me if it was my first
   time to come to Dubai. I told her I was passing thru as well, and that
   Dubai is my hub for travel coming from Afghanistan. She couldn’t quite
   believe that I worked there.

   She and her son had an easy, loving banter — Omar was very well
   behaved, not once did she have to scold or raise her voice at him. He
   shook my hand graciously when I introduced myself to him and asked his
   name. He had very beautiful brown eyes, with long, sooty lashes.

   I asked them to share the limo with me as we were all going to the mall
   anyway. The lady was glad to have company and readily accepted. They
   wanted to see the Aquarium, so I decided to go to Dubai Mall as well.
   On the drive over the lady would point out landmarks and buildings to
   her son. At night, the Burj Khalifa was lit up, a silver sword rising
   from the vast, twinkling desert. Omar said, “It looks awesome, mom!”

   As we sped by the traffic-less streets, Omar looked out the window,
   mouth open at the sights. It gave me a new appreciation for this city
   that I would pass by so often, seeing it now through this boy’s eyes.
   It made me miss my sons, made me instantly fond of this dark eyed
   little boy.

   Passing by yet another skyscraper, Omar pointed to it and said, “Mom, I
   wanna go up there, can I go up there?

   His mom laughed and said, “Oh sweetie, you can go wherever you want.”
   She turned to me and gave me a smile, her dark eyes sparkling. I knew
   exactly what she meant, and I smiled back.

     * What is an oxymoron?
       An Oxymoron is a combination of contradictory or incongruous words,
       such as 'Cruel Kindness' or 'Jumbo Shrimp' (Jumbo means 'large'
       while Shrimp means 'small').
       It is a literary figure of speech in which opposite or
       contradictory words, terms, phrases or ideas are combined to create
       a rhetorical effect by paradoxical means.
       The word 'Oxymoron' is originally derived from the Greek elements:
       oxy = sharp and moros (moron) = dull (foolish). 'Oxymoron' is the
       singular form, and 'Oxymora' (or 'Oxymorons') is the plural form.
       We are all oxymorons, we tend to run into all sorts of
       contradictions. I am an oxymoron--several apply, in fact. Solo
       parent. Grown-up girl. Cheerfully cynical. Open secret. But I guess
       being all that is still better than being just a plain moron, don't
       you think?

[11]Why is the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong important

   Posted on [12]October 3, 2014 by [13]Bevan Chuang
   [14]Reply
   Why is this important?
   Under the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the Constituional Document based on
   the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by Margaret Thatcher and Deng
   Xiaoping in 1984. In accordance with the “One Country Two Systems”
   principle, China is not to extended her practice of socialism into Hong
   Kong, and Hong Kong will continue its previous capitalist system and
   its way of life for a period of 50 years after 1997.

   In particular, under Chapter 4 of the Basic Law, Hong Kongers were
   guaranteed “the selection of Chief Executive and members of legislature
   is to be ultimately by means of universal suffrage.”

   In a White Paper published by Beijing earlier this year, Beijing stated
   that “it has complete jurisdiction over the territory and the source of
   its autonomy.” Beijing has given Hong Kongers restricted “Universal
   Suffrage” by appoiting a 1200-member nominatig committee that would
   select two or three candidates, of which when one is selected through
   “universal suffrage”, the Chief Executive-elect will have to be
   appointed by the central people’s government.
   Why is this important to the world?

   The former rivals for leadership of the Communist world also
   increasingly share a brand of anti-Western nationalism that could
   colour President Xi Jinping’s view of the pro-democracy protests in
   Hong Kong. Beijing accuses Western governments of stirring unrest
   there, much as Mr. Putin blamed the West for the pro-democracy protests
   in Kiev that began late last year.

   Russia has begun portraying the Hong Kong protests, too, as
   U.S.-inspired. Russian state-controlled television channels this week
   claimed that Hong Kong protest leaders had received American training.
   The world should be watching as China is increasingly influential in
   global matters such as finance and politics. This helps us to have
   better understanding of their way of working.

   What are they protesting for?
   Hong Kongers have been protesting since 1997 and have esculated over
   time. They are protesting for a dialogue, protesting to ask the Chief
   Executive Leung Chun-Ying to honour his words, protesting to China to
   honour their agreement as per Basic Law.

   What does this mean?
   There are discussions on the consequences of Occupy Hong Kong.
   1. China would not let Hong Kong dictates how they will govern the
   country. A real sign of weakness and if Hong Kong succeed,  other
   regions in China may follow and seek some kinds of suffrage
   2. Taiwan may now have autonomy, but China wants her back. Taiwan may
   not buy into the “One Country Two System” that China has been promoting
   as a successful way to integrade the countries but ensure people will
   continue its previous capitalist system and its way of life.
   3. President Xi Jingping cannot and do not want to back down. His
   anti-corrpution campaigned had made him some powerful internal enemies
   and they are biding their time and waiting for him to make a false
   move. Backing down showed that he is weak.

   What next?
   Many believes that China is playing the endurance war with Hong Kongers
   and spreading propaganda such as how the Occupiers are disrupting
   people’s normal daily life, blocking emergency services and the police
   force are angry with some protesters.

   The endurance game will spark a division within the Hong Kongers.
   Business will start saying that they are suffering, the Hong Kong Stock
   Exchange will start saying that the markets are down thus effecting the
   global market with uncertainty, some protesters will be be fed up with
   this and starts acting violently. The worry is whether China will bring
   in the People’s Liberation Army as they have already been spotted in
   various locations in Hong Kong. They are cautious as they know the
   world is watching and they do not want a repeat of the Tienanmen Square
   Masscare.

[21]Open Letter to World TV in regards to Occupy China

   3rd October 2014

   To Whom It May Concern

   In relation to the Occupy Central discussions presenters had on Hello
   New Zealand dated 3rd October

   We are concerned and angry with the discussions your presenters had on
   the Hello New Zealand programme dated 3rd October. We believe that it
   has already breached the Broadcasting Standards and we strongly
   condemned such actions.

   In particular the presenters mentioned that Occupy Central has
   disrupted normal ambulance services (discussions began at 26:40
   online), and this is incorrect. On Tuesday 30 September, Hong Kong Fire
   Services Department Ambulancemen’s Union President Mr Shi-ki Chan had
   informed the media that he has not received any cases affected by the
   protests. In addition Director General Ki-on Wat mentioned that the
   protesters were cooperative and would make way for servicemen to
   provide help when needed.

   When challenged by listeners, presenters have continuously referred to
   the news as presented by Commercial Radio in the morning, where a
   driver who had a heart attacked, had delayed rescued due to the traffic
   jam caused by Occupy Central. His family members had clarified later on
   Facebook that that the delay had nothing to do with Occupy Central.

   The Presenters have seriously breached the Broadcasting Act 1989.

   Standard 4: Controversial Issues – Viewpoints

   When discussing controversial issues of public importance in news,
   current affairs or factual programmes, broadcasters should make
   reasonable efforts, or give reasonable opportunities, to present
   significant points of view either in the same programme or in other
   programmes within the period of current interest.

   Guidelines
   4a The assessment of whether a reasonable range of views has been
   allowed for takes
   account of some or all of the following:
   • the programme introduction;
   • the approach of the programme (e.g. taking a particular perspective);
   • whether listeners could reasonably be expected to be aware of views
   expressed in
   other coverage;
   • the programme type (e.g. talk or talkback which may be subject to a
   lesser requirement to present a range of views)

   Standard 5: Accuracy

   Broadcasters should make reasonable efforts to ensure that news,
   current affairs and factual programming:
   • is accurate in relation to all material points of fact; and/or
   • does not mislead.
   Guidelines
   5a The accuracy standard does not apply to statements which are clearly
   distinguishable as analysis, comment or opinion.
   5b Talkback radio will not usually be subject to the accuracy standard,
   except where the presenter makes an unqualified statement of fact.
   5c In the event that a material error of fact has occurred,
   broadcasters should correct it at the earliest appropriate opportunity.

   We urge World TV to take our concerns and complain serious and openly
   correct its errors.

   Yours Sincerely,
   New Zealand Hong Kongers

   有關10月3日Hello紐西蘭主持人對佔中的報導

   有關貴公司的主持人於10月3日在Hello
   紐西蘭中有關佔中的談話內容我們深切遺憾並感到憤怒。認為主持人已經違反新西蘭無線電台的廣播條例，我們在此強烈譴責。

   主要關注內容乃主持人表示因佔中而影響救護人活動
   （網播26:40開始），此乃失實報導。因在9月30日星期二香港時間下午時間，消防處救護員會主席陳仕祺已經表示手上確切救援個案受示威影響的資料。

[36]New Zealand For Hong Kong

   Posted on [37]October 1, 2014 by [38]Bevan Chuang
   [39]Reply

   Auckland Protest 1 October 2014

   New Zealanders set up peaceful protests in Auckland, Palmserton North,
   Wellington, Chistchurch and Dunedin on 30 September and 1 October to
   support the students and Hong Kongers fighting for their rights to
   demand universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

   I am very proud and honoured to be part of this great team. The events
   were organised by volunteers within 2 days, and over 600 people have
   already attended the event. The team is amazing, and definitely showing
   the HK spirit, which is not different to New Zealand’s “No. 8 Wire”
   spirits. Just getting things done.

   The Hong Kongers in New Zealand are outraged with what they have been
   seeing from Hong Kong, protesters attacked by tear gas and pepper
   spray. While the Hong Kong government deemed the event as illegal,
   protesters do not believe that the amount of force was neccessary to
   force them to leave.

   The event was organised as part of a global movement to support those
   in Hong Kong and although there was a very short notice, we have
   managed to get the number of people we needed and the huge mainstream
   media interest.

   The fight is an important one. We here in New Zealand have been very
   lucky. We had a general election more than 10 days ago and New Zealand
   citizens have the rights to choose who to govern. Irrespective of the
   outcome, this is democractic rights that many people in the world do
   not have.

   Some argued that Hong Kong never had democracy so why are they asking
   for it now? How dare they asked for it now. Well, talk to the British
   and Chinese who signed and finalised the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special
   Administrative Region. The Basic Law guaranteed Hong Kongers the rights
   to democracy. The rights to choose who they wanted to rule the city.
   Instead, by 2017, the offer given to Hong Kongers was not universal
   suffrage. Hong Kongers were given a list of nominees, pre-selected and
   agreed by the Chinese government. Choosing an orange over another
   orange is not really a choice.

   In my view, Hong Kongers are protesting for more than just their rights
   to vote, but the many social unrests and unhappiness since 1 July 1997.
   The Chinese tourists, the Chinese property buyers, the Chinese who
   bought all the infant formular, the Chinese who pooped and peed in the
   main streets, the Hong Kong government that forced students to learn
   about the Communist Party. The list goes on.

   I am not sure how long the protest will last but surely it is an
   enduring one. It is so loving when a lady from Czech Republic came up
   to me and said “Please keep fighting. I came from Czech Republic and I
   know how important this is.”

   We will keep fighting. And thank you again for your support, Kiwis!

[61]紐西蘭2014大選和華社

   Posted on [62]September 27, 2014 by [63]Bevan Chuang
   [64]Reply

   看到華裔參選人在華媒發表選後感，覺得有點可笑。當然看到這篇文章的大家可能會覺得我這個過氣緋聞女主角憑什麼出來做任何的評論。這次大選我個人很留意
   個華社的討論，覺得很有趣。對於主流媒體也覺得是一個很重要和有趣的觀察，希望能夠分享。

   [65]20140927_204131_mh1411807344044

   在網上看到大家熱烈的討論，發現華人根本不是不熱衷政治。當然，剛剛才移民到紐西蘭的可能會比較不參與，就算對台灣或香港這些有民選投票的地方來講，紐
   西蘭的政治跟國內等大中華地方的都很不一樣，需要一點的適應。

   [66]20140927_203933_mh1411807442454

   華人朋友對於政治所關心的也是有所不同。大部分都很關注移民政策，這對主流媒體和很多紐人來說不是最重要的。可是大家還是會對於經濟民生等基本的政策還
   是有興趣的，還是會關注的。

   [67]20140927_203939_mh1411807409344

   競選期間每個政黨和其支持者無所不用其技的希望他們的政黨和候選人能得到最多的票。什麼骯髒政治和國家機密等等，沒有一天不是為人所討論的。但當我們在
   討論這些所有紐西蘭人都在討論的議題時，大家有認真留意各政黨是如何針對華人選票的嗎？

   行動黨的王小選在奧克蘭各處在豎起夾雜着繁簡體中文和充满了争议的廣告牌；在各地華人聚雜的地方發出中文的傳單；給華人、不會中文的華人、甚至老外寄出
   寫著中文的信；目的當然是希望可以強華人票。

   各華人媒體和團體邀請華人候選人（但都忘記了工黨的吳昭甫）出席不同的訪問和活動。甚至聯民Mana黨（大部分的華人媒體都直接翻譯成互聯網嗎哪黨）都
   派發中文的傳單，在網絡上推廣他們的政策。目的當讓都希望借這個機會拉到華人的票。

   但大家在討論了很多華人候選人都忽略的要點到現在還是沒有一個候選人有認真處理的：
    1. 華人議員和候選人平時有接觸選民嗎？
       華人議員和候選人平時也沒有接觸選民；做了什麼，他們是誰，選民根本不知道。很多候選人出席很多華社的活動，但這都是一小撮的華人，其他選民有
       見過他們嗎？他們參加不同華社的社團服務，目的真的是為了貢獻給華社嗎？當一些華人社團接觸你們需要你的幫助的時候，你有切切實實的幫助他們嗎
       ？
    2. 華人議員真的能夠幫助到華人嗎？
       進入國會的華人目前大部分都是以不分區(List
       MP)的方式，他們其實不算是“民選”的，華人也知道他們是沒有義務要協助華人社區的。而且平時華人有事的時候也不見得他們會力挺。大選的時候
       打著華人幫華人的旗號，真的會幫忙嗎？
    3. 華人候選人都以為所有華人都不懂英文也不跟主流媒體嗎？
       當一個政黨一直打著“華人要團結”的口號，但另一邊卻發出反華的宣傳單張。要團結的話，你要華人如何給你支持呢？或者，打著一個什麼反種族歧視
       的口號，但政黨卻被主流媒體質問他們帶有的種族歧視的政策，對嗎？大選時候說什麼華人要共同努力，但平時在國會裏面卻發表了一些帶有歧視的議題
       ，政黨發出一些針對華社的議案時也不發出反對聲音。難道大家也真的以為華社不知道嗎？
    4. 華人真的只是因為你是華人而投票嗎？
       華人的票不應該只是為了你是華人而支持你。你帶進國會的還有你所屬政黨的其他黨員和政策，這才是正真影響民生的決策。胡亂只因為你的族裔而投票
       是否有點魯莽呢？
    5. 有試過一步一步的拜票嗎？
       華人候選人有多少個真的一步一步的每家每戶敲門拜票的？有試過在路邊風吹雨打地拿著廣告叫人家投給他們的？有多少人試過在每個禮拜在辦公室每家
       每戶的打電話拜票？
    6. 華人的票數能有什麼的影響嗎？
       是的，紐西蘭有二十萬華人。但不是全部都是選民，而且能影響到票數的方向跟毛利裔和太平洋島裔的是很不一樣。毛利有他們的特別票。島裔的聚集在
       奧克蘭南區，他們都能影響選區的結果，可是華人沒有那麼聚集，所以很難影響到選區結果。

   當華人候選人要求華人們投他們票的時候，請認真看看平時你們為華社做了什麼。大選的時候也請確保政黨的信息跟你發出的是一模一樣。出醜了，華人會覺得你
   說的太有目的，也不會給你投票了。而你們一直打著”華人為華人說話“的這句選舉口號都變得多餘了。

[77]Racism and power play well and alive in New Zealand

   Posted on [78]September 23, 2014 by [79]Bevan Chuang
   [80]Reply

   Congratulations that New Zealand has made it onto the international
   news, and it is not about the General Election.

   Driver Ganesh Paramanathan, left, and policewoman Jeanette McNee,
   right. Photo / supplied

   Malaysian-born-Indian Queenstown taxi driver, Ganesh Paramanthan, and
   New Zealand-born-Caucasian policewoman Jeanette McNee made it to the
   news on [81]Times of India and [82]Zee News in India for McNee’s racist
   outburst against Paramanthan, who told him

     “F*** off to India. You come here and get all of the Kiwi jobs, eat
     your f*** curry and f*** off to India. This is a Kiwi job.”

   According to the [83]report, McNee has taken Tramadol and Ibuprofen
   pills to ease pain following an unsuccessful hip operation, followed by
   five glasses of wine over the evening. Arguments between McNee and
   Paramanthan took place over disagreement of fare and has refused futher
   payment after a female passenger paid $40 and got off the taxi earlier
   that night.

   In additional to the abusive language, McNee has used force by
   squeezing and twisting the wrist of Paramanthan. When Paramanthan
   warned McNee  not to touch him and that he would call the police, McNee
   held the door handle and said ‘I am the police’.

   McNee was found guilty but [84]discharged without conviction yesterday
   but an internal employment investigation has been launched.

   If McNee has done her homework, or if her doctor has informed her,
   Tramadol is a narcotic-like pain reliever. It clearly states on
   [85]Drugs.com

     “You should not take tramadol if you have used alcohol, sedatives,
     tranquilizers, or narcotic medications within the past few hours”

     “Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death can occur
     when alcohol is combined with tramadol.”

   Therefore, when McNee’s lawyer Nick Soper defended her client by saying
   she has no memory of the incident, the general public should be
   concerned, very very concern.
    1. Mixing any drugs with alcohol is never a good idea. Particularly
       when Tramadol is a narcotic-like drug and it is like doing dope
       with alcohol; very very bad mix.
    2. When a policeperson exercise her power over another person, in this
       case, putting force over a taxi driver, this is not acceptable.
    3. No taxi drivers need to tolerate abusive passengers. Irrespective
       of your status and role, they are only doing a job. Should anyone
       think that the taxi drivers are over charging, one should be able
       to make a formal complaint with the [86]New Zealand Taxi
       Federation. Assalting another person is actually against the law
       and as a law enforcer, McNee should know this is not acceptable.
    4. Racism has no place in New Zealand, though this is something that
       is very much well and alive. Listening to to [87]Sean Plunket on
       RadioLive this morning it is clear that many people think “we
       should just get over it”. If the story was a Caucasian taxi driver
       abused by an Indian policeman, the response could be quite
       different.
    5. Queenstown is an important tourism attraction for New Zealand.
       Comments on the [88]Times of India is certainly not positive for
       New Zealand.

   McNee;s behaviour brought embarrasement to the NZ Police force:

     “Southern District Commander Superintendent Andrew Coster said
     police expected the highest standards from staff in both their
     personal and professional conduct and the behaviour described in the
     court case involving McNee did not align with police organisational
     values or its code of conduct.”

   New Zealand Police won the Excellence in Recognising Ethnic Diversity
   in [89]2011 and   in [90]2012 at the IPANZ Gen-I Public Sector
   Excellence Awards. In 2004, the Police published a policy entitled
   “[91]Working Together with Ethnic Communities – Police Ethnic Strategy
   towards 2010” which aims to ensure that the Police can work effectively
   with the growing diversity. Prior to that in 2009, they have published
   “[92]A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity” which aims was
   designed to assist police performing their duties and to give them a
   greater understanding of the cultures they dealt with.

   In 2006, New Zealand Police published a report called “[93]Ethnic
   Community Perceptions of New Zealand Police“. In it, one of the
   recommendation was that there needs to be an improvement in the
   relationship between ethnic communities and New Zealand Police. There
   needs to be a two-way process where both parties work towards the goal
   of a fruitful and valuable relationship.

   In it, one of the major negative impression the ethnic communities have
   of the New Zealand Police was:

     “Negative attitudes surfaced because of perceptions of police bias,
     stereotypical preconceptions and prejudices; and a perceived lack of
     fair treatment in comparison with other New Zealanders. Some of the
     words the respondents used to describe their negative experiences
     with police included: “unapproachable”, “don’t understand us”,
     “don’t protect us”, “powerful and intimidating”, “help the offender
     not the victim”, “do not help migrants”, “migrants are not treated
     as Kiwis”, and “victim made to feel like a criminal”.

     “The perception that police were more likely to judge a migrant as
     “in the wrong” was prevalent within many communities including
     Chinese, Middle Eastern, Indian and Korean. Often victims who
     reported crimes felt they were “interrogated” or “blamed” and it was
     somehow their fault they had experienced the crime.”

   McNee’s behaviour have not only damanged herself but the reputation of
   the New Zealand Police and New Zealand. A disgrace and there should be
   zero tolerance towards such behaviour. There is a need for the New
   Zealand Police to take this seriously and let them know that racism is
   not acceptable if they are serious about working with the comunities.

[103]Migrant Chinese and New Zealand Politics

   Posted on [104]September 15, 2014 by [105]Bevan Chuang

   The migrant Chinese population and New Zealand politics. No this is not
   about the racist comments made by different political parties because
   it attract certain votes. Nor it is about how ethnic media present
   politics, which I have already [107]written about. This is my
   observations of the migrant Chinese community and their interactions
   with New Zealand politics.

   The migrant Chinese community I am talking about is predominately those
   who are from mainland China, speaks Mandarin, write in simplified
   Chinese, came to New Zealand in the last 10 – 15 years, who are between
   25 – 45 years old, and active online. It is a specific group that may
   not be representative for all of migrant Chinese but it gives a very
   interesting broad brush observations of the migrant Chinese community
   in NZ.

   I’ve been observing the online polls that were created on the
   [108]discussion board on Skykiwi, New Zealand’s largest Chinese
   website. Discussion forums is where migrant Chinese exchange dialogues,
   ask questions, seek support, and even promote their own services. They
   discuss everything from childbirth, immigrant matters, where to sell my
   car. Anything.

   Skykiwi created a dedicated [109]discussion forum on the General
   Election this year. The forum allowed Skykiwi to provide general
   election information such as the election system, what is MMP, and
   questions you may have for MPs.

   [110]skykiwi The discussion on the forums is very very active and I’ve
   previously [111]discussed the dedicated Conservative Party member whose
   passion have sadly created a counter-effect on the party.

   What do the Chinese discuss, online, and consider as their key issues?
    1. Chinese Candidates
       Not surprisingly, the Chinese community is questioning the Chinese
       candidates and their effectiveness with the political parties.
       Are the Chinese candidates doing enough to support the Chinese
       communities?
       Are they even useful? What have they done?
       Are they representative?
       Are they just puppets?
       Why did Act’s Kenneth Wang keep using “anti-racism” as their
       slogans and attack Winston Peters even though Peters may not be
       loved by the Chinese community?
       Where were the Chinese MPs when they isn’t an election?
    2. Parties and Policies
       Who are these parties?
       What are their policies on matters such as immigration, employment,
       business?
       What are their views on foreign ownership?

   The one thing that surprised many from the informal polls that were
   running on the forum is the amount of people who supports New Zealand
   First and the lack of support with Greens.

   [112]poll [113]poll1

   The assumptions are that Greens support better environement and
   therefore many Chinese who came from a polluted country must support
   Greens; and the racist comments by Winston Peters must be a turn off.

   Sadly no. Green maybe supporting an environmental friendly New Zealand,
   but for many Chinese, New Zealand is already much cleaner and greener
   than China. However, Greens’ support of Tibet independence is a major
   barrier for migrant Chinese. Greens’ policies are not discussed online
   at all. No one is interested at all.

   As for good ‘ol Winnie, well you’ve got to say his “foreign land sell
   ban” is actually much appreciated by the Chinese! Well the Conservative
   and Labour both also supported this, but their Chinese specific
   comments have made it very difficult for the Chinese to accept.
   Winnie’s “Two Wongs Don’t Make a Right” joke only created a very small
   noise within the migrant Chinese community because many are simply used
   to his racist remarks.

   With 200,000 Chinese living in New Zealand, I do think it is about time
   that they take us seriously. It is not true that the Chinese community
   is not passionate about New Zealand politics; it is only because they
   do not feel engaged, included, and understood. If you still think you
   can get away with it, think again. Even the National Party have started
   a WeChat account to engage with the Chinese community through mobile
   apps.

[130]Dedicated Conservative Member… With the Adverse Effect.

   Posted on [131]September 6, 2014 by [132]Bevan Chuang
   [133]1

   I believed I was a little mean to this young man who have been a
   volunteer in East Coast Bay for the Conservative Party this week.

   Well, what happened? Someone [134]posted on the discussion board of
   Skykiwi, the largest Chinese website in New Zealand, that they’ve
   received the flyers from Conservative Party and as soon as they opned
   it up, they saw the “Sold to the Chinese” in big red stamp.

   I won’t go into the details of the flyer and my views on this. You can
   read other Jack Yan’s [137]article if you are interested in some of the
   discussions related to the flyer.

   The person who posted the original article was surprised to receive
   this flyer in his mailbox; he was going to vote for the Conservative
   Party.

   [138]conservative1

     本来已经打算把票投给保守党了，他的很多政策都和我的胃口。可是今天收到了这个宣传册，你让我怎么投？
     我想基本每家人手一份吧。不拿中国人说事就活不下去么？Paul Yang你还有脸在这个政党呆下去?
     为了一点选票来挑动国内民族矛盾，怎么这里的政党都这么的SB呢？


     I was planning to vote for the Conservative Party, many of their
     policies meet my needs. However, after I received this flyer, how
     should I vote?

     I believe every family would have received one? Why do you have to
     talk about the Chinese? How can Paul Young (typo) stay in this
     party?

     How could you incite ethnic rivalry within the country for a little
     bit of votes, why are the political parties so silly?

   This post has attracted a total of 84 response, and over 1200 views (at
   the time of writing this blog) with many outraged by Conservative’s
   flyer on how they targetted the Chinese. The people who commented in
   this discussion completely understand the importance of keeping New
   Zealand’s land and farm, in New Zealand. So no one was upset about the
   foreign speculator issue. They were just upset that the flyer said
   “Sold to the Chinese” instead of “Sold to the Foreigners”.

    [139] conservative2 [140]conservative3

   The issue came about when this person called “[141]鹬鸵圣者” (Saint Kiwi)
   came around and started commenting. It was found out later that he is a
   member and volunteer of Conservative Party based in East Coast who have
   been helping to distribute the flyers.

   [142]conservative4 [143]conservative5

   Great to have his input, but it went so off that people started
   targetting him.

   [144]conservative6

     好吧，我都没话了…你发传单的时候看过里面内容了么？
     我都不知道你当时怎么想的，作为一个华人，分发着一份指明点姓，红色大标题说华人不是的宣传单给街区。还让我说什么？
     这个不是全国的，反正我基督城的朋友有收到。
     保守党的政策全部都和我胃口，就因为这一点我也要骂！要呛！要出声！

     OK, so have you read the content?

     I am not sure how you think at he time, as a Chinese, distributing a
     flyer that target specific group, talk about how bad the Chinese
     are, what can I say?

     I am not sure if this distributed nation wide, but my friends in
     Christchurch received it.I share Conservative Party’s philosophy but
     just because of this, I need to talk about and make a point!

   [145]conservative7

   Sadly it comments made by Saint Kiwi has just keep going worse…

     是哪国的外商都会写的，如果下次有欧洲来的、美洲来的投资者，保守党也会指名道姓。
     将来在议会中，保守党还会对准首相、毛利人、还有老温。Colin 就是一个不怕得罪任何人的人。
     Colin 家庭经营的几个企业里头华裔员工很多，他个人对华裔很好的。

     We would write about any foreign buyer. If it is the European or
     American investor the next time, Conservative Party will point them
     out too.

     In the future parliament, Conservative will target the PM, Maori and
     Winston Peters. Colin isn’t afraid to offend anyone.

     Collin has a lot of Chinese staff in his various business, and he is
     also treat the Chinese very well.

   Sadly, no one let him go and he then reply saying he expect an apology
   from the Party next week (Monday 8 September)

   [146]conservative8

   And so people complained about how they understand the foreign land
   ownership issue and they absolutely agree that New Zealand should not
   sell them to foreigners. Again, it was targetting the Chinese that they
   found uncomfortable.

   [147]conservative10

   I’ve asked Saint Kiwi how much influence he has and how can he say it
   is ok. He replied:

   [148]conservative11

     其实我自己也不认为是什么事的。因为当我考虑自己的时候， Chinese 仅仅是个无关轻重的
     ethnicity，何况宣传册上写的也都是事实，并没有捏造问题。

     I don’t think it is a problem. Because when I thought about it,
     Chinese is merely just an ethnicity and the information on the
     brochure are facts, not made up.

   [149]conservative11

   No, I said to Saint Kiwi, Chinese is not the biggest foreign buyer
   according to Statistics New Zealand’s year end 31 December 2013 figures
   and the sale to Lochinver is yet to be confirmed. That didn’t stop the
   enthusaistic Saint Kiwi to reply:

   [150]conservative12

     不，我认为这么做只会减少选票。
     Colin 的习惯就是不在乎选票，是在乎 issue， 尤其是 current issue ，他对选民的期待也是看大局，而忘我。
     并且其它国家的投资大多数已经是过去的事了。而现在提到的是现在正在发生的事。

     Colin is  not about the number of votes, but issues, particularly
     current issues. He wanted the voters to see the bigger picture and
     forget about himself.

     Other foreign countries investing in New Zealand was in the past. We
     are talking about now.


   So sadly, Saint Kiwi dug a hole for himself when he said Colin is not
   worried about votes, Chinese voters, and how he came across.

   [151]conservative13 [152]conservative14 [153]conservative15
   [154]conservative16

   It is absolutely great to see Chinese being involved in the political
   parties as many are discussion the lack of representations of Chinese
   in New Zealand’s politics. This is just an interesting discussion and
   have sadly pushing a few more potential voters for the Conservative
   Parties.

   Who said the Chinese are not interested in politics?

   Dear Editor,

   Your reader, Frans de Court, is not accurate to say that Hong Kong’s
   property prices has dramatically slowed follow the introduction of
   stamp duty. According to a report by [169]Bloomberg in January 2014,
   Hong Kong havebeen named one of the least affordable housing markets
   across nine nations in the Demographia International Housing
   Affordability survey. The median home price in Hong Kong is 14.9 times
   the gross annual median household income.

   The stamp duty price has only made small impact to the [170]overheated
   housing market and low-medium income earners are still unable to afford
   a house, with the average price per square foot at HKD$8020, approx
   NZD$1240.

   Hong Kong’s property price is driven by speculators, as well as the
   cost and lack of land. Hong Kongers are living in illegal
   [171]subdivided units that can only fit one single bed for
   approximately NZD$600 per month. One rule does not fit all and I
   certainly do not see Hong Kong’s stamp duty policy the one that fits
   New Zealand.

   Regards
   Bevan Chuang

[181]Supporting Asian language at schools, really?

   Posted on [182]August 29, 2014 by [183]Bevan Chuang
   [184]Reply

   In a Facebook post by the National Party yesterday, they have announced
   [185]$10 million to increase Asian languages in school. They aim of the
   budget is, according to Hekia Parata:

     “we need to provide young New Zealanders with opportunities to learn
     the languages of countries that we have strong trade relationships
     with.”


     “Since 2008, our trade with China has quadrupled and it is now our
     second largest export market. As a result of this strengthening
     relationship, National has decided to prioritise Mandarin as the
     primary focus of this new funding.”

   For a split second, I’ve cringed. Big time.

   Yes I am Hong Kong Chinese and I am triliterate and trilingual. I can
   read and write English, [186]Traditional and [187]Simplified Chinese,
   and speaks English, [188]Cantonese and [189]Mandarin. My mother tongue
   is Cantonese, English is my second language and Mandarin is actually my
   third. I’ve learnt other languages in the past such as Japanese and
   Spanish. I should therefore, support the National’s policy to establish
   or enhance Asian language programmes.

   I do, in principal. Learning a foreign language at school has its
   [190]advantages and [191]disadvantanges. There is a whole different
   discussion on whether te reo Maori should be made compulsory at school,
   whether to all students, or just for all schools to have the options to
   teach.

   Let me share my views about teaching of Asian languages, particularly
   Mandarin, xthat caused me to cringe when I first saw this media
   release.
    1. [192]Mandarin Chinese is the “official language” in China. It was
       not adapted as the “Standard Chinese” by the Peoples’ Republic of
       China until early 20th century, after winning one vote over
       [193]Cantonese due to political reasons. The current
       [194]controversy in China is that the government is trying to
       [195]supress the use of various dialects within China by
       [196]persistent drive towards promoting the ‘standard’ language.
       Cantonese is spoken by more than 60 million people in China and
       many are upset with the government because it does not only mean
       the dying of a language, but the culture, and history and
       historical artefacts where written Cantonese were printed on.
       Beijing made Mandarin the country’s official language in 1982,
       leading to bans on other languages at many radio and television
       stations. The number of Cantonese speaking Chinese in China has
       declined significantly over the last three decades as it is no
       longer supported by schools and society. Non-Cantonese speakers’
       name-callings online during debates, such as calling Cantonese as
       language for “barbarian”, “uncivilized”, “uneducated” people etc.,
       has further deepened the hostility between Mandarin and Cantonese
       speakers.
       I remember speaking to a senior NZ politician about China’s
       encouragement of banning the use of Cantonese in public which he
       think it is right and should be supported. Gobsmack moment. It
       would be simply saying that we should not have Maori broadcasted in
       public media in New Zealand and everyone should only speak English.

    2. Cantonese is the mother tongue of early Chinese settlers in New
       Zealand. Early Chinese settlers came from Southern China, many were
       originated from the Canton/South of Guangdong area. They actually
       do not speak or understand Mandarin. When New Zealand Government
       apologised to New Zealand Chinese in 2002 for the poll tax history,
       the Chinese Poll Tax Heritage Trust was established in 2004 and the
       goal is intended as a gesture of goodwill to poll tax payers, their
       descendants and future generations, in recognition of the hardship
       caused by the poll tax and other discriminatory legislation.
       Part of the mission of the Trust is to promote “learning and use of
       the Cantonese language” as it helps promote the preservation of
       Chinese New Zealand history, language and culture. The Poll Tax
       descendants who run Chinese schools around New Zealand will tell
       you that the number of students in Cantonese classes have decrease
       significantly. Poll Tax descendants are more interested in putting
       their children into Mandarin Chinese classes than Cantonese because
       they see Mandarin as more “functional”.
    3. There are two different written language in Chinese, the
       Traditional and Simplified Chinese. While the media release talked
       about “Mandarin Chinese”, I would assumed there would be some
       support to the written Chinese as well as you cannot learn without
       both the spoken and written language.
       The Traditional Chinese is the Chinese characters derived from the
       Pictorial Chinese in Han Dynasty since 206 BC – 220 AD. Traditional
       Chinese characters are currently used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
       Macau; as well as Overseas Chinese communities outside of Southeast
       Asia.
       Simplified Chinese was promoted by China for use in printing since
       the 1950s and 1960s in an attempt to increase literacy. They are
       officially used in the People’s Republic of China and Singapore.
       There is a [197]debate about the use of Traditional and Simplified
       Chinese characters amongst the Chinese diaspora, comparing the
       various cultural, historical and political debate.
    4. Are we putting too much eggs into the “China” basket? It is not
       news that various industries, such as [198]dairy and [199]meat, has
       warned New Zealand against being too dependent on China, which the
       Prime Minister has [200]denied. As an Investment Banker, he must
       understand the theory of not putting all eggs into the same basket.
       As a matter of fact we only need to look across the ditch to know
       that Australian’s economy has not been doing as well as predicted
       because Chinese have stopped investing into their mining industry.
       If you have been reading articles from publications such as
       [201]Forbes or [202]Bloomberg, you may note that while they do
       predict a strong economy, the growth will remain at 7%. They need
       to build on their infrastructures and supplying for their local
       demand on essentials. The question is, will China provide a good
       ‘return’ on our ‘investment’? Should we also invest in other
       economic powers such as the other members of BRICS and Indonesia?
       Should we encourage our students to learn Hindi, Portuguese, Bahasa
       Indonesia?

   There are various issues related to the increase of Mandarin Chinese
   support that, though I support fundamentally, am very uncomfortable
   with. Call me protective but my turf, my culture, is for us to protect.
   [203]Unesco has identified a Chinese languages that will disappear by
   the end of this century. China already has a long list of
   [204]endangered language and I, as part Manchurian, feel strongly about
   language preservation, if not revival, as it holds some very important
   knowledge for our success.

[224]Migrants Votes for Aotearoa

   Posted on [225]August 27, 2014 by [226]Bevan Chuang
   [227]1

   Yet another [228]story about how migrants are not voting in New Zealand
   and therefore they are not being actively engaging in New Zealand and
   the democratic system.

   [229]nzherald Chinese media were told by a group of Chinese political
   candidates, at a forum held by Mandarin Pages, that “You cannot
   consider New Zealand to be your adopted home if you don’t vote,”.

   Registrar of Electors team leader Kenneth Lam, representing the
   Electoral Commission at the forum, said most recent Chinese migrants
   were from mainland China and “did not fully understand” the democratic
   process.

     “There is no such thing as an election in China so everything about
     voting will be new to them,” Mr Lam said.

     “For many of them their first priority is to settle down, and they
     don’t know much about the policies or the candidates.”

     Mr Lam said the commission had been working with Chinese
     associations around the country to encourage Chinese to vote. Having
     Asian candidates had helped generate interest.

   This totally contradicts the research by [230]Statistics New Zealand
   last year about migrants’ sense of belonging:

     “long-term migrants are even more likely than New Zealand-born
     residents to vote, according to new Statistics New Zealand
     research.”

   If we look at the 2011 election turnout, only 74.21% voted. Sadly I
   don’t believe that the rest of the 25.79% are all migrants.

   I remember when I ran for the Local Government elections in 2013,
   Mandarin Times organised a similar forum, invited all Chinese
   candidates to attend to talk about themselves and invited them again
   after the election to talk about how they felt. We all played that “yes
   we need the Chinese community to get out to vote.”  I was lucky because
   there were no other Chinese candidates in Central Auckland I could
   compete with so whether they win or not has little influence over me.
   We were all commemorate of each another, even if we may be, in terms of
   party lines, against each another. We all spoke as a united groupd and
   is overly friendly with each another.

   But with a central government election like this, where would you get
   such commemorative candidates than the Chinese community. For one,
   there were only 4 to begin with, so we know each another. Secondly, all
   the Chinese candidates depends on the success of their party to get
   into the parliament. Raymond Huo is no 21 on the [231]Labour list; Dr
   Jian Yang is no 33 on the [232]National List, and Kenneth Wang, Deputy
   Leader, is no 2 on the [233]Act Party List.. Paul Young is not  even on
   the [234]Conservative List. One other Labour listed candidate, Chao-Fu
   Wu, didn’t even show up at this forum, and that maybe because he is on
   number 57 and there are very little chance of getting into the
   parliament.

   To assume that they do not fully understand the democratic process is
   wrong; and to assume that no Mainland Chinese migrants will vote
   because their priority is settling down is very wrong. Let me tell you
   why I think the migrant Chinese turn out is low.
    1. Chinese media relied on New Zealand Herald for their source of news
       and information. Many migrants whose English maybe their second
       language listen to the Chinese media which translated stories
       printed on New Zealand Herald as their source. This is in no way
       undermining the accuracy of New Zealand Herald. However, the
       translations are not always accurate as many of them were neither
       trained professional translators nor trained journalists. They
       would sometime miss out parts of the story which could be important
       for some audience to have a good understanding of the politics or
       policies.
    2. The Chinese community do have active discussions about politics and
       policies on various platforms such as radio and [235]online forums
       by Skykiwi. However, if you listen to the discussions on various
       talk back radio programmes, you can get a sense that many of them,
       particularly those from Mainland China who have a very different
       system than New Zealand, would often compare the various policies
       between their home country and New Zealand. While comparing
       experiences and policies around the world could be beneficial,
       clinging onto how your home country deal with certain issues is
       another. Some migrants lack the understanding of New Zealand system
       and cultures to understand how policies are developed.
    3. The usefulness of Chinese MPs have been questioned amongst the
       Chinese community. As they are listed MPs, they technically do not
       need to listen to the Chinese voters. And within Duncan Garner’s
       [236]10 most useless List MPs in 2011 – 2014, all ethnic MPs were
       on the list. They attend numerous events for the party, attend
       numerous ethnic forums like the one recently organised, to speak
       about the party, translate for their party leaders. Very rarely,
       you see the Chinese MPs actually speaking on stage, as themselves.
       Very often, they are seen as a translator. The Chinese community
       observed this, and questioned, why should one support the Chinese
       MPs?
    4. The Mainland Chinese community may not have a background of
       democratic election, but not all of them are new to this country.
       Many have been here for more than 5 years and therefore settling in
       a new country is no longer an issue but understanding the policies
       and politicians may still be.
    5. The typical non-voters are not different to Chinese non-voters.
       Some of the reasons people [237]may not vote included:
          + I don’t know enough about the issues or people standing for
            election
          + I’m too busy to vote
          + Too difficult to go to vote/can’t get to a polling station
          + Dislike politicians, the political system, or all parties
          + It makes no difference which party is in government

   The Chinese community wanted to vote on issues that they agree with;
   like any other New Zealanders. Their English may not be as good, and
   they may have difficulties understanding some of the policies and
   issues raised in the mainstream media, but they are not that different
   to other New Zealanders.

   If the parties are serious about the Chinese votes, they should be
   doing something throughout the year to show what are the benefits of
   having the Chinese MPs in their lists and not just to tick the box or
   act as a translator. The Chinese MPs could do more by really getting
   out to the Chinese community, not just at different events, but

[53]PDP Chieftain Sentenced To Life Imprisonment for R*ping Pregnant APC

   [59][NO-to-RAPE...jpg] Obafemi Kolawole, a political associate to Chief
   Ganiyu Oladiran, a Peoples Democratic Party
   chieftain in Ilesa, was on 23 September 2014
   convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment
   with whipping for r*pe.
   The said Obafemi was alleged to have on 15th
   September 2007 r*ped an Action Congress of
   Nigeria (now All Progressives Congress)
   member (Tosin Ajakaye, who was pregnant as
   at the time of the incident) after the 2007
   gubernatorial election in Osun state.
   Kolawole was charged before the State High
   Court sitting at Ilesa, on a two-count charge of
   r*pe and indecent assault contrary to Sections
   358&360 of the Criminal Code cap 34, Vol II,
   Laws of Osun respectively in the case of The
   State Vs Obafemi Kolawole HIL\2c\2009.
   The prosecution called a total of four witnesses
   including Tosin Ajakaye, Lawal Sikiru, Dr. A.I
   Isawumi and the Investigating police officer Sgt
   Olatunji Arojo in proof of its case, while
   Obafemi testified in his defence and called
   additional four witnesses including Chief
   Ganiyu Oladiran, Adediran Kehinde, Adewusi
   Olowolodu and Olayinka Alege.
   At the trial, the prosecutor narrated her ordeal
   that on 15th September, 2007, the convict and
   his cohorts, who are not police officers came to
   arrest her at her house at about 7:30 p.m. for
   an unknown offence. On sighting them and
   knowing their antecedent in the vicinity, she
   took to her heels. The convict pursued, caught
   up with her and beat her up. Having
   overpowered her, he stripped her naked and
   r*ped her.
   “When my cry for help became unbearable, he
   covered her mouth. Unfortunately, those living
   in the same compound with me had gone to
   Mosque because it was the period of the
   Muslim fast. Thereafter he bundled me into a
   waiting jeep to join two other men whom I
   found in the same predicament as mine,” she
   said.
   She later explained that they were driven to
   the home of Chief Ganiyu Oladiran, a PDP
   chieftain, and tied to a tree where the trios
   were mercilessly flogged. She said Kolawole
   later untied her and plucked out her pubic hair,
   put it in her mouth to swallow with dry gin,
   and thereafter went ahead to insert a tin
   opener into her vagina and as well poured dry
   gin all over her body. There he r*ped her
   again.
   PDP symbol
   Lawal Sikiru who testified as ‘prosecutor
   witness 2′ corroborated her story. He said he
   was one of the two naked men in the waiting
   jeep; the other was one Gbadamosi Lasun. He
   stated further that he had earlier on received
   his own share of beating, and bundled naked
   into the jeep belonging to Chief Ganiyu
   Oladiran when Ajakaye was brought in naked.
   He confirmed that the trio were driven to Chief
   Ganiyu’s house and tied to a tree where they
   were mercilessly beaten and the content of dry
   gin was poured all over their body.
   According to him, Ajakaye was untied by the
   accused who plucked out her pubic hair,
   inserted a tin opener into her vagina, and as
   well went ahead to pour dry gin in her (vagina)
   and then sought the consent of the Chief to
   have s*xual intercourse with her.
   The chief consented and she was taken to the
   boot of the jeep from where they heard her
   shouting for help.
   The Medical examination conducted on Ajakaye
   three days after the incident at LAUTECH by Dr.
   Isawumi revealed that there was penetration
   and that the swap taken from her was full of
   alcohol. It was also discovered medically, that
   as at the time of the incident the prosecution
   was pregnant.
   Sgt Arojo the IPO, on his own part, testified
   that Ajakaye and others were brought to the
   State Police Command Monitoring Unit at
   Okefia by Chief Ganiyu Oladiran who claimed
   that the trio whom he got arrested were the
   ones who assaulted him after the April 2007
   Gubernatorial Election in the State.
   According to him, while receiving the
   statements of all concerned, and conducting
   investigation into the matter, it was discovered
   that Chief Ganiyu Oladiran’s captives were
   indeed the victims, and the supposed
   complainants and cohorts were the accused
   persons and were consequently charged to
   court.
   Obafemi Kolawole (the convict) in his own
   defence, denied the allegations made against
   him. He admitted going to Ajakaye’s house on
   the fateful day and arresting her, but denied
   stripping her naked, rather he handed her over
   to his colleagues, who drove her and other
   captives to Chief Ganiyu’s house, where they
   were later handed over to the police.
   His other witnesses also admitted that Ajakaye
   and others were driven to the Chief’s house.
   Chief Ganiyu Oladiran, while testifying in
   defense of the accused claimed his co-accused
   at the Magistrate Court who arrested the trio
   were his sympathizers.
   The presiding Judge, Honourable Justice A. B.
   Abdulkareem, while finding the accused guilty
   as charged, pronounced that although the
   corroboration of prosecution witness two was
   limited to assault, it does not corroborate
   penetration which is the vital ingredient
   necessary for r*pe.
   However, the medical report tendered by Dr
   Isawumi corroborated the needed penetration
   and he thereafter found Kolawole guilty. The
   learned trial Judge held that the Prosecution
   Counsel Mrs Rachel Ojimi, a Chief State
   Counsel, in the Ministry of Justice, has been
   able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt
   and consequently convicted the accused. He
   however struck out the charge of indecent
   assault since it carries a lesser punishment.
   The imports of this judgment are as follows:
   (a) Our society is still governed by laws
   and that notwithstanding the fact that you
   have perceived that some individuals
   have wronged you does not give you the
   liberty or license to take laws into your
   hands and forgetting the maxim ’UBI JUS
   IBI REMEDIUM’ meaning, where there is a
   right, there is a concomitant remedy.
   (b) That our courts are still the last hope
   of the common man, though justice may
   be slow yet its long hand will surely catch
   up with the offender no matter how
   highly or lowly placed or affiliated to a
   political party.

[61]HORROR: Nigerian airforce pilot beheaded by Boko Haram. (New video and
Photos)

   Before his beheading, the pilot reportedly gave his
   name, rank and date of birth, which is 1975 and
   also said
   "I'm a pilot of the Nigerian air-force. On
   September 11th, I was assigned on a mission
   to Kawuri, Borno state. During the mission we
   were shot down and our aircraft crashed. To
   this day, I don't know the whereabouts of my
   second pilot. I was taken into the care of
   (Boko Haram). At the time of the crash, I
   sustained cuts and broken hand and some
   other injuries to the head.
   After saying this, the pilot was forced to the ground
   and his head chopped off with a pick axe. The pilot
   is said to be a Wing Commander[67] [0_3.png] A new video is reported to
   have been released to
   AP by Boko Haram men showing the beheading of
   a man said to be a military pilot who co-piloted the
   missing Naval air force jet.
   The video also shows burnt out plane parts with
   Nigerian military markings. Two pilots and an
   Alpha jet have been missing since Sept. 11. Below
   is the report from AP...
   A new video allegedly shows Boko Haram
   leader Abubakar Shekau disputing claims of
   his death, and the beheading of a man who
   identifies himself as the pilot of a missing
   Nigerian Air Force jet. It shows burnt out
   plane parts with Nigerian military markings,
   the first indication that Nigeria's homegrown
   Islamic extremists have the capability to
   shoot down aircraft. The man beheaded with
   an axe identifies himself as a wing
   commander, saying he has not seen his
   second pilot since the jet was shot down.

[96]REVEALED!! What Weightlifting For Just 20 Minutes Can Do For Your Brain!

   [102][Wight-lifting.jpg] It's no secret that weightlifting is good for
   you,
   but now a new study on brains and brawn
   suggests that going hard in the gym for as little
   as 20 minutes can boost your long-term
   memory by 10 percent.
   “Our study indicates that people don’t have to
   dedicate large amounts of time to give their
   brain a boost,” study leader Lisa Weinberg, a
   graduate student at the Georgia Institute of
   Technology, said in a written statement.
   For the study, researchers asked 46 healthy
   young adults to try to remember a series of 90
   photographs that were shown on a computer
   screen. Then half of the group worked out on a
   leg-extension exercise machine -- doing 50 reps
   -- while the other half sat in a chair and didn't
   exercise. The researchers then took saliva
   samples from each person.
   Two days later, the same men and women met
   with the researchers again to look at a series of
   180 photographs, which included the 90 photos
   that were shown before. This time, the men
   and women were asked to recall which photos
   they had seen previously and which were new.
   What did the researchers find?
   The people who exercised remembered around
   60 percent of the photos they had seen before,
   while those who didn't exercise remembered
   only around 50 percent.
   Previous research in older men and women (50
   to 85 years old) has found that a brief workout
   improves memory due to the exercise-induced
   release of the stress hormone norepinephrine.
   Scientists have long known that the hormone, a
   chemical messenger in the brain, plays a strong
   role in memory.
   And it turns out that, in this new study, those
   people who exercised had increased measures
   of norepinephrine in their saliva samples. See
   the connection?
   “The findings are encouraging," study co-
   author Dr. Audrey Duarte, an associate
   professor of psychology at the institute, said in
   the statement.
   "Even without doing expensive fMRI scans, our
   results give us an idea of what areas of the
   brain might be supporting these exercise-
   induced memory benefits."

[104]Welbeck hits back over goals record

   Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck has hit back at the critics who have
   questioned his goalscoring record.
   The 23-year-old has fired four goals in his last three games for
   Arsenal, after his £16m move from Manchester United.
   It is the perfect riposte to those who have suggested the frontman
   isn't clinical enough, including United manager Louis van Gaal.

   Wenger 'didn't realise' Welbeck was so fast
   "If you are getting goals and a run of games in your preferred
   position, your confidence will grow," Welbeck said.
   Asked to explain why he allowed Welbeck to join Premier League rivals
   Arsenal on transfer deadline day, Van Gaal had pointed to the striker's
   record in front of goal.
   "He played three seasons for the first team, but he doesn't have the
   record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney, and that is the standard,"
   the Dutchman said.
   Welbeck netted 29 times in 142 United appearances, compared to Rooney's
   217 goals in 445 matches and Van Persie's 48 in 78 games.
   But the striker was used out of position for the majority of his time
   at Old Trafford, often playing on the wing.
   At Arsenal, he is leading the line and says that has made all the
   difference.
   Ex-Arsenal defender Martin Keown on Welbeck
   "The fans already have a special relationship with Danny Welbeck and
   they're singing his name. He'll be realising his career is taking off,
   he's the darling of the Arsenal fans. He just keeps making the runs,
   he's loving his football, he's got a smile on his face and the goals
   keep coming."
   "Obviously people can say I have not scored enough goals, but you stick
   the best strikers on the wing in a four-man midfield and see if they
   score," said Welbeck, who hit a Champions League hat-trick against
   Galatasaray on Wednesday.
   "Nobody can really criticise my finishing because they don't really see
   me playing in a forward position too often.
   "But now I am getting into these positions I want to be sticking the
   ball in the back of the net. I am sure it's the same with every other
   striker."
   Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he had been impressed with the manner
   in which Welbeck has started his Arsenal career.
   "You can see that he's improving," said Wenger. "That is very positive
   and there's a lot more to come from him,"
   Arsenal face Premier League leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on
   Sunday, before Welbeck turns his attention to England's Euro 2016
   qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.
   The striker led the line in England's opening qualifier last month in
   Switzerland and scored both goals in a 2-0 win.

[112]Barcelona star Lionel Messi faces tax evasion trial

   Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi is to face trial for alleged
   tax evasion, a Spanish judge has ruled.

   The judge rejected a prosecution recommendation to drop the charges on
   the grounds the player's father was responsible for his finances.

   Messi and his father Jorge are accused of defrauding the authorities of
   more than 4m euros (£3.1m; $5m).

   The pair, who deny wrongdoing, have five days to appeal against the
   ruling.

   It is alleged that they withheld the money between 2007 and 2009.

   The income related to Messi's image rights, including contracts with
   Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Proctor and Gamble, and the
   Kuwait Food Company.

   Messi and his father paid 5m euros back to the Spanish tax authorities
   The footballer and his father are suspected of avoiding paying Spanish
   tax by using companies in Belize and Uruguay to sell the rights to use
   Messi's image.

   The judge ruled: "In this type of crime, it is not necessary for
   someone to have complete knowledge of all the accounting and business
   operations nor the exact quantity, rather it is sufficient to be aware
   of the designs to commit fraud and consent to them."

   In August 2013 Messi and his father made a 5m euro "corrective
   payment", equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest.

   Messi has been four times Fifa World Player of the Year and is captain
   of Argentina.

   The court decision comes as Barcelona grapples with a separate
   prominent legal case.

   A Madrid court is hearing a lawsuit that accuses Barcelona of
   misappropriating funds from the transfer fee to buy Brazil striker
   Neymar from Santos in 2013.

   Club president Sandro Rosell quit in January, but insisted he had
   "acted correctly" over the transfer.

   Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says "there is no racism in football",
   amid calls to introduce American Football's 'Rooney Rule' to the game
   in England.
   With only two black managers in the Premier League and Football League,
   such a rule would require at least one black or ethnic minority
   candidate to be interviewed for each vacancy.
   But Mourinho said: "Football is not so stupid to close doors to people.
   "If you are good, you get the job. If you are top, you are top."

   Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will wait to see whether Daniel
   Sturridge is fit enough to be involved against West Brom tomorrow.
   The striker has missed six matches with a thigh strain and while he is
   edging closer to full fitness he has been left out of England's
   European Qualifiers due to his lack of action.
   Defenders Glen Johnson and Mamadou Sakho (both thigh), Jon Flanagan
   (knee), midfielders Joe Allen (knee) and Emre Can (ankle) are all

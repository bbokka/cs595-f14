[15]The obligatory ‘first day of preschool’ post

   Posted on [16]September 24, 2014 by [17]Man Vs Pink

   My daughter and I in happier times…

   Well, that was emotional.

   I took my daughter to preschool earlier this morning. We’ve been
   explaining to her what it is for a while. How it’s like playgroup but
   without daddies & mummies. That a few of her friends will be there. And
   how daddy will take her, play for a little bit, go away for a bit, and
   then come back to take her home. She seemed ok with it. All went as
   expected. Especially the ‘go away bit’ unfortunately.

   10 mins after arriving, I gently backed away as she was occupied at the
   play-doh table, one of her favourite activities.

   I watched from the kitchen. She was happily for a while, but then I
   could see it developing. The play-doh squishing slowed. Her head began
   to glance around. The lower lip began to quiver. Then the tears began
   to flow. Not sad tears, but utterly inconsolable distraught tears, with
   the barely discernible cries of “Daddy! I want my daddy!”.

   I exchanged looks with her key worker, who indicated I should hang back
   while she tried to placate my daughter with a story. But it was to no
   avail, so she brought my daughter over to me.

   My daughter held me tighter than she ever has, repeating over and over
   through the stream of tears “Daddy! I love my daddy!”. It was a scene
   reminiscent of the ending of ‘The Railway Children’.

   Except, in this case the ‘Daddy’ (me) then abandoned said daughter when
   she was distracted by the outdoor play, as it was decided this was for
   the best in helping her adjust, but they would call me if she got too
   upset and couldn’t be calmed down.

   So here I am at home, with a cup of tea and a bacon sandwich for
   emotional comfort, staring at the phone hoping it doesn’t ring.

   The 2 1/2 hour preschool session, that I thought wouldn’t be long
   enough to get much done, now seems to be lasting an eternity.

[36]LEGO Fusion: A new brick in the gender divide

   Posted on [37]August 30, 2014 by [38]Man Vs Pink

   LEGO’s new Fusion line may meld real & digital worlds, but it still
   divides our boys & girls.

   [39]IMG_0848-0

   A LEGO ‘Universal Building Set’ ad from 1982, depicting a boy and girl
   playing together with the same LEGO. Crazy.

   I had high hopes when I was [40]alerted to ‘LEGO Fusion’. It was the
   word ‘fusion’, the combining of two distinct entities into one, that
   piqued my interest.

   LEGO have rightly had a lot of flack for creating and marketing their
   product separately to boys and girls in recent years, especially given
   their history of previously being a universal toy. So would this new
   fusion line finally reunify the divided markets and be aimed at both?

   The word fusion also brings to mind various scientific processes and
   ideas, most notably nuclear fusion. Could this be a line linked
   specifically to STEM fields, in which female inclusion and engagement
   remains an ongoing issue.

   Don’t be silly.

   Turns out the ‘fusion’ aspect is the connection of physical building
   with virtual construction, in the form of smartphone & tablet apps and
   associated physical sets. The virtual aspect appears to be inspired
   partly by [41]The Sims and [42]Civilisation - but mostly by
   [43]Minecraft, the open world virtual brick building phenomenon. LEGO
   have stated that they wish they had invented Minecraft. In fact, it was
   created by a games designer from the Danish toymaker’s Nordic neighbour
   Sweden. Minecraft also has a large number of female enthusiasts (though
   evidence suggests they may often not admit to being female, given how
   women are often treated in online & gaming circles – but that’s another
   issue!).

   So LEGO Fusion may not be the revolutionary science based line I
   imagined (I actually have no idea what that could be, but I was waiting
   to be dazzled), but still – it’s an innovation for the company to move
   its core product – bricks – into virtual space. Good for them. And it’s
   a concept clearly able to be enjoyed by boys and girls.

   But then I saw this promotional video for it. It effectively conveys
   the blending of virtual and actual space, focusing on a child exploring
   the worlds that the line consists of.

   IFRAME:
   [44]http://www.youtube.com/embed/C83Ukgga8kc?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&shows
   earch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   First there’s Town Master, where you get to be a town planner/ruler.
   That’s followed by Battle Towers, a virtual war space where your
   constructed ‘Battle Tower’ has to fend off an enemy invasion. Then
   there’s Create & Race, where you build cars and race them. As ideas,
   they all look and sound pretty cool. But, there’s something important
   missing from the marketing hyperbole. Girls.

   And then it happens.

   Two girls are shown playing on the other side of the table from the
   boy. What are they doing – planning a town? Creating a battle tower?
   Engineering their own race car?

   Nope.

   The girls have their own app and set, within the gender ghetto of the
   LEGO Friends line. And what do the girls get to create in their fusion
   space? Their line is called Resort Designer, and they have to create… a
   dream beach resort.

   IMG_0855

   In LEGO Fusion, boys build towns and engineer machines, while girls get
   to build… a resort

   So rather than fusion, we have division & limitation. Physicist,
   oceanographer and broadcaster [45]Dr. Helen Czerski memorably responded
   on Twitter to the LEGO Fusion ad with “Ick”.

   Dr. Czerski continued “Obviously, all girls are interested in is
   holiday resorts, while boys get on with building our cities.”

   The whole reason advertising exists is that it works. If it can
   persuade us to part with our cash for a product, then it stands to
   reason that the reality it depicts is also convincing.

   There’s nothing stopping you – or I – from countering these messages
   ourselves to our kids, but we’ll never be able to fend them off
   entirely. The seed will be planted, that will potentially grow into
   deep rooted conviction that may see a girl choosing very early on in
   life not to embark on a life in science, technology, engineering or
   manufacturing, and may lead to an adult male choosing not employ a
   woman in one of these fields, because from childhood, without even
   realising it, they have learned that these areas are inherently male.

   I don’t think LEGO is evil, that it is trying to socially engineer a
   world where women are directed to a pastel coloured inconsequential
   cul-de-sac while the men take care of the important stuff. They’re just
   trying to sell their plastic bricks. But doing it by entrenching gender
   segregation, and limiting the life choices of our girls, is simply
   wrong. I can’t say it plainer than that.

   Imagine, if instead of gender, LEGO based their marketing around race.
   Imagine if the Fusion ads showed white people (as they do) playing with
   the Town, Racing, and Battle lines – and then depicted stereotyped
   minorities in and using sets based on sports, hospitality, or a
   factory? Imagine if they produced market research that showed that this
   was what the minorities in question wanted. That they were just
   supplying demand. It would rightly be labelled as racism.

   Oh god, I do hope I haven’t given them a new marketing angle to try
   out…

   Back in the real world, my daughter will continue to play with her
   hand-me-down LEGO, that hails from the time when it was a universal
   toy. And maybe when LEGO pulls back on the gender based madness, we’ll
   hand over some real money for new LEGO.

   As long as it remains backwards compatible with the concept of
   universal building.

   ============

   [46]IMG_0856

   The sold out, universally acclaimed, LEGO Ideas Research Institute.
   Hopefully not the last you’ll see of it.

   One set I would have parted cash with was their much heralded
   [47]Female Scientist set.

   In a bad month of gender news for LEGO, they also revealed that this
   set, which I didn’t even get a chance to buy, is in fact a limited
   edition.

   Currently sold out, while LEGO have said they are going to release more
   stock, there is no indication that this means they will actually
   manufacture any more.

   If you – like me – think this obviously popular set should be mass
   produced, then please sign [48]this petition created by Melissa Atkins
   Wardy (Author of “Redefining Girly”, owner of [49]Pigtail Pals &
   Ballcap Buddies).

   Apparently, a new LEGO design must achieve sales of [50]£106,000 to
   break even. At £15.99 a pop, this set needs to sell about 6,600 units –
   so the petition needs to reach at least that figure to show there’s a
   viable market for it (though the fact it achieved 10,000 public votes
   to get made in the first place should be enough!).

   [51]So please sign and share!

[73]What’s the opposite of a Troll? I reckon it’s an Emily…

   Posted on [74]July 6, 2014 by [75]Man Vs Pink

   [76]IMG_0568

   The ways in which strangers comment and connect online usually gets a
   bad rap. Perhaps because it’s so easy to take on another identity – or
   remain anonymous – in order to be vile to another person. A ‘troll’
   used to be a goat eating creature that lived under a bridge in the
   minds of children. Sadly that monster has been usurped by an all too
   human counterpart.

   But what of the wonderful instances of selfless acts of generosity and
   human kindness that also occur online? Well, here’s one for you.

   [77]"#WeWant Leia" by Yakface.com

   I recently [78]blogged about the Disney Store’s lack of Princess Leia
   products, and their absense of interest making any. As the dad of a
   Star Wars loving daughter, I hoped for some meaningful response from
   Disney, and there was a muted assurance that they will produce Leia
   merchandise in the future.

   But the post also elicited [79]this response from a lady called Emily:

     “I don’t know if it would interest you, but I have a Leia doll and
     several of the Episode 1 Amidala dolls (all still in boxes because
     that’s how I was). It’s not the iconic Leia w/ buns, but they’re
     just sitting in storage and I’d be happy to dust them off and send
     them to you to share with your daughter. I may have some action
     figures but I think I gave those away already.”

   Well yes, of course I was interested, so I followed up with Emily via
   email. The back and forth conversation basically went like this.

     Me: I’m certainly interested, but how much do you want for them?

     Emily:   Oh I don’t need anything in return. I know how it was
     growing up a girl in a Star Wars world, so I’ll gladly share what I
     have

   Wow, that’s really generous. But hang on, there’s a problem – it’s not
   like I can just pop round and pick them up. We don’t live very near
   each other. In fact, we’re very far from each other. Emily lives in the
   US and we live in the UK. She replied:

     Emily: I have no problem sending them across the ocean – they’re
     just collecting dust in storage right now and I’m happy to send them
     off to a better home.

   Once again, wow.

Special international delivery

   True to her word, some days later, we had a large package arrive in the
   post from America, which contained three boxed 12″ Queen Amidala dolls,
   a boxed 12″ Princess Leia doll, and a bonus item of a large Queen
   Amidala towel. It also came with the following handwritten note from
   Emily:


     Simon,

     I hope your daughter enjoys these dolls. I’m happy to share my love
     of Star Wars with your daughter and your family. Hopefully these
     will help fill the gap until some new official merchandise surfaces.

     I only have one Leia doll, but Amidala/Padmé was marketed a fair
     bit, with her many dresses and hairstyles. Like many overzealous
     fans, I snapped up what I could, but already being in high school, I
     never played with them – just had them on a shelf in my Star Wars
     covered room until another interest came along and they got put into
     storage for 10 or so years. Now they can leave their boxes for some
     proper playtime.

     Enjoy! And may the force be with you, always!

     Sincerely,

     Emily

   Emily then signed off with these delightful Princess Leia
   illustrations.

   Emily's Leia doodles

   So it was with great relish – and Emily’s permission – that my daughter
   and I finally liberated these toys from the packaging they had been in
   for the best part of the past 15 years. It would be a sight to horrify
   many a Star Wars collector, but delight anyone who gains any happiness
   from the pure joy of a child.

   My daugher loves these dolls. She is already swapping shoes and outfits
   between them. Ceremonial Leia looks pretty good wearing Padme’s large
   brown boots. ‘Royal Elegance Queen Amidala’s red shoes are a popular
   interchangeable item as well. There’s also some toddler hairstyling and
   tea parties happening.

“You never forget kids like Emily”

   In 1999, the year that The Phantom Menace was out and Emily purchased
   all these dolls, another eagerly anticipated movie was released.
   Eerily, it features a young lady called Emily who parted company with
   her childhood playthings.

   In Toy Story 2 we are introduced to Jessie, a once beloved doll who has
   been abandoned at a roadside when her ‘Emily’ outgrew her. In reality,
   perfectly normal behaviour, but in the story it was a source of great
   sadness and emotional trauma for Jessie, who mournfully states: “You
   never forget kids like Emily…but they forget you.”

   Well, this real life Emily didn’t forget about her toys. They may not
   have been played with, but they were bought out of love (of Star Wars),
   and passed on for the same reason.

   According to Buzz Lightyear “(a toy’s) life’s only worth living if
   you’re being loved by a kid”. Well thanks to their Emily these toys
   will be well loved by our kid. They are out of their boxes and never
   going back in!

   The Emilys of the real world should be celebrated. She reached out to a
   father and daughter she has never met, with whom she had only had the
   briefest of online interaction with, and made the great effort to not
   just simply give us these toys she purchased, but to ship them across
   the world to us at her expense.

   It also reminded me of the end of Toy Story 3,
   when…***SPOILERS*** …Andy hands over his childhood toys to the little
   girl family friend.

   IMG_1855 That brought a tear to my eye, and I have to admit, this did
   too.

   So thank you Emily. As well as giving us these awesome dolls, you have
   also given me renewed optimism about the world I am raising my daughter
   in.

   And Disney take note. There IS a girls market for Star Wars, and there
   always has been.

   (Oh, while I immensely appreciate Emily’s generosity in giving these
   dolls to my daughter, at my insistence we have reimbursed Emily for the
   shipping. She also has a big credit in the favour bank)

[101]Watch Emma Watson Explain Why She’s a Feminist

   Posted on [102]September 23, 2014 by [103]Man Vs Pink

   [104]Man Vs Pink:

     If any guy reading this hasn’t seen Emma Watson’s speech yet – or at
     least read the text – then I implore you to do so. We need you to
     add your voice to drown out the dickheads who think that ‘feminism’
     is a trigger for misogyny and abuse of our women and girls.

   Originally posted on [105]TIME:

   British actress Emma Watson [106]called on men and boys around the
   globe to join the movement for gender equality during a moving speech
   given in her role as U.N. Women global goodwill ambassador.

   “I want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters, sisters and
   mothers can be free from prejudice, but also so that their sons have
   permission to be vulnerable and human too — reclaim those parts of
   themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete
   version of themselves,” she said at the U.N. headquarters in New York
   City on Saturday.

   The 24-year-old actress, who gained worldwide fame for her role as
   Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movie franchise, was speaking as
   part of the [107]HeForShe global solidarity movement to promote women’s
   rights and equality between the sexes.

[124]One Thing Kim Kardashian Is Really Doing Right with Baby
North’s Clothing

[145]RECIPE: Shrimp/Prawn linguine (aka Linguine al gamberi)

   Posted on [146]August 30, 2014 by [147]Man Vs Pink
   [148]Linguine al gamberi

   Linguine al gamberi

   Whether you call this crustacean a shrimp or a prawn, what we can all
   agree on is that you must – if at all possible – make a stock with the
   heads & shells.

   I first had this on honeymoon on the Italian island of [149]Ponza, a
   favourite Mediterranean getaway for Romans seeking respite from the
   capital’s summer inferno. Delicious Italian seafood tops the menus of
   eateries across the island.

   What ensures that this seemingly simple dish evokes the sea is the rich
   prawn stock, layered with the other flavours, all unified at the end by
   finishing the linguine in the sauce.

   For an extra sumptuousness, use butter as well as oil to make the
   stock, and add a glug of wine when simmering tomatoes. You could also
   sieve the tomatoes before cooking for a smoother texture.

   I have been generous with the serving size. The depth of flavour is
   incredibly moreish, so you should make plenty. It’s also advisable to
   have some nice bread on standby. However full you may be, you will
   likely still feel an overwhelming need to mop up any excess sauce.

   Serves 4

   INGREDIENTS:
     * 500g linguine
     * 800g large raw prawns/shrimp, shelled & deveined (retain heads &
       shells for stock)
     * 1 shallot, finely chopped
     * 1-6 cloves garlic, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
     * 1-2 chillies, deseeded and finely chopped (adjust to taste)
     * 500g sweet cherry tomatoes, quartered
     * Stock (see below)
     * Juice & zest of 2 lemons
     * Large handful flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
     * Olive oil
     * Salt & pepper
     * Glass white wine (optional)

   Stock
     * Olive oil
     * Prawn heads & shells
     * Large glass white wine
     * 250 ml water
     * Salt & pepper
     * 50g butter (optional)

   METHOD:
    1. In a large saucepan on a medium heat, fry prawn heads & shells in
       generous glug of olive oil. When pink, add white wine. After a few
       minutes when alcohol has evaporated, add equal amount of water and
       simmer for approx 10 minutes. Crush heads & shells while cooking to
       release as much flavour as possible. Top up water if necessary, and
       season to taste. Strain and retain stock.
    2. In a large wide bottomed pan, fry shallot on a medium heat. After 5
       minutes, add garlic & chilli and cook for a few more minutes. Add
       tomatoes and gently simmer for at least 15 minutes, gradually
       adding strained stock.
    3. Cook linguine in salted water (allegedly should be as salty as the
       Mediterranean) to about a minute or 2 less than packet
       instructions. If sauce gets too thick during pasta cooking, add
       some of the linguine water, tbsp at a time. Retain a cup of water
       before draining for same reason.
    4. Add prawns to sauce – for larger prawns cook for couple of minutes.
    5. Drain and stir in the linguine, add lemon zest, season to taste,
       and cook for further couple of minutes until pasta is al dente.
       Loosen sauce with some retained pasta water if necessary.
    6. Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat. Cover and leave for five
       minutes. Pasta will absorb even more flavour from the sauce, but
       without cooking further.
    7. Add parsley, and serve in warmed pasta bowls.

[169]In defence of Mr. Mom

   Posted on [170]August 26, 2014 by [171]Man Vs Pink
   [172]'Mr. Mom' (1983) poster

   ‘Mr. Mom’ (1983) poster

   This isn’t defending the 1983 Michael Keaton movie. I certainly have
   fond memories of it, and I have no reason to believe it to be
   significantly better or worse than its 80’s comedic peers, such as
   ‘Police Academy’, ‘Bachelor Party’, and ‘Stripes’.

   No, this is about the term ‘Mr. Mom’ being applied to real life at-home
   dads. It seems a lot of us home-dads don’t like it. When I say us, I
   don’t mean me – I’m fine with it. In fact, I encourage it.

   This week there was a nice piece by Nicole Shanklin, whose husband was
   an at-home dad to their daughter for 2 1/2 years, titled ‘[173]Modern
   Parenting: Mr. Mom Style‘. Lots of fellow (blogging) dads while
   complimentary about the post were less so about the inclusion of Mr.
   Mom in the title (check the comments). So much so that it was changed
   to ‘Modern Parenting: Stay @ Home Dads Rock’, which I think is a shame.

   What are the arguments against its use? Well, fairly valid ones:
   Working mothers are not called ‘Ms. Dad'; being an at-home father
   doesn’t make you a male mother; what’s wrong with just calling us dads?

   And yet… When I became an at-home dad over 2 years ago, I relished the
   moniker of ‘Mr. Mom’, and I still do. While stay-at home dad is a fair
   description of my role, as is the shorter at-home dad, they lack the
   wordplay of Mr. Mom, and honestly – they simply fail to conjure up that
   image of Michael Keaton holding up his baby’s bottom to a hand-dryer.

   Perhaps this is a clue to why I like the term. Keaton’s expression in
   that image exudes confidence. One aspect of our role that many at-home
   dads will tell you is a feeling – often borne out through experience –
   of being judged about our ability as primary caregiver, because we are
   dads. That we are perceived as less able parents because we are men,
   that our ‘male’ methods are inferior to ‘female’ ones – which from
   memory is also a theme of the movie.

   In some aspects, I do parent differently from my wife. Not better or
   worse, just different. Is this because we are male and female? I have
   no idea. My daughter wears a lot of superhero t-shirts, knows more Star
   Wars characters at age 2 than my wife does at age [REDACTED], and will
   respond to [174]food made with scotch bonnet chillies with an
   enthusiastic ‘More!’. Have I introduced these things to her because I
   am a man? I’m sure any mothers into comics, Star Wars, and hot food
   would disagree with that notion (you know who you are…).

   But for me, to feel confident about my way of parenting & to introduce
   my daughter to things I am passionate about is fundamentally important.
   I don’t want to second guess myself and be consumed with self doubt
   about whether this is really the right or wrong thing to do – or even
   worse, to change my behaviour because I am worried about how others
   might judge me. Is drying a baby’s bum on a hand-dryer unorthodox?
   Sure. But that doesn’t mean it’s the wrong thing to do (although I’m
   not advocating it).

   So I like to channel the Mr. Mom in that poster, the confident dad
   parenting his way.

   However, perhaps the main reason that I don’t have a problem with it is
   this: I’m English. We don’t use the word ‘Mom’ – it’s ‘Mum’. To us,
   ‘Mom’ is basically an exotic word from a foreign culture, so when
   someone calls me Mr. Mom (which people do) I simply think of Michael
   Keaton in that poster. It’s a pop culture reference that makes me
   smile, and I don’t think I’m being made to feel like any less of a dad.

   However, if anyone asks me if I’m ‘babysitting’? Grrrr…

[195]Girls & boys toys: Is the toy biz being demonised for just
supplying demand?

   Posted on [196]August 11, 2014 by [197]Man Vs Pink
   [198]IMG_2903

   Our X-Men Barbie: If she was an actual toy (as opposed to Beach Barbie
   wearing a Storm circa ’96 outfit), would she be categorised as a boy’s
   or girl’s one?

   If the toy industry were at all sympathetic to the issue of their
   gender division of toys, we wouldn’t have to keep complaining. But is
   it fair to criticise them?

   Recently, kids brand consultant – and father of 2 girls – Steve Reece
   ([199]@nevetseceer) wrote [200]this piece on it. Let’s just say it lost
   me at labelling those like myself, who disagree with the gender
   categorisation of toys, as ‘bandwagon jumping opportunists’ – and it
   went downhill from there. I shared it on Twitter, tagging Steve, and he
   & others responded.

   Rarely does anything useful or constructive result from people with
   entrenched opposing opinions debating online. This was no exception.

   As the twitter back & forth ensued, there were many of his points I
   failed to adequately address or respond to. Other people, notably
   scholar Elizabeth Sweet, had a more meaningful contribution. Here’s my
   tweet, followed by a sub-edited version of the ensuing conversation.

     I dare you to read this and not get annoyed. ‘Gender specific toys
     ain’t over yet’ [201]http://t.co/RSbk4VRqeO by toy consultant
     [202]@nevetseceer

     — Man vs Pink (@ManVsPink) [203]August 8, 2014

   [204]Carrie Proctor: Does Steve Reece not see that children pick
   certain toys because they’re taught to do so by society?

   Steve Reece: I agree with you…kids choose toys based on societal
   influence…majority of parents see boys & girls toys still

   Carrie Proctor: That’s why we try to get toys for our daughter in
   bright primary colours. She’ll pick her own favourite one day. :-)
   (Favourited by SR)

   Enter Dr. Elizabeth Sweet, a Postdoctoral Scholar whose current
   research focuses on gender and children’s toys. So far more qualified
   than me/most in this area.

   [205]Dr. Elizabeth Sweet: My research finds that toys are far more
   gender segregated and stereotyped now than ever before. Simply not true
   that toys have always been so gender defined nor that they have to be.

   My initial tweet also provoked this response from freelance writer Lisa
   Granshaw.

     [206]@ManVsPink Yup, annoyed… — Lisa Granshaw (@LisaGranshaw)
     [207]August 8, 2014

   I then noticed that Steve had tweeted a response to those criticising
   his article, and the conversation shifted over to that thread.

     Note on gender and toys article in [208]@ToyNewsOnline
     [209]#reflectingcurrentreality
     [210]#notsayingitshouldbethatwayjustthatitis

     — Steve Reece (@nevetseceer) [211]August 8, 2014

   (ICYMI – Steve’s hashtag reads: Reflecting current reality, not saying
   it should be that way, just that it is)

   Elizabeth Sweet initially responded (before I butted in).

   Elizabeth Sweet: Actually, not a reflection of current reality if you
   look at demographic & attitudinal measures in re: to gender. I would
   revise [212]this piece I wrote in 2012 to say that gendering today is
   far more extreme than in ’50s.

   Steve Reece: Really…? Difference between what people say hypothetically
   versus Behaviour measured by what sells…?

   Elizabeth Sweet: When you only offer people one choice (e.g. highly
   gendered toys), is it surprising that they choose it?

   Me: (To Steve) Chicken/Egg. They buy what you sell. I’d buy more female
   Star Wars & superhero toys if sold.

   Steve Reece: You may buy, but are there enough like minded to justify
   tooling etc? Toy companies supply to demand.

   Me: How do you know girls won’t buy/play Star Wars/Marvel, when they’re
   labeled as ‘boys’ brands?

   Elizabeth Sweet: Toy companies are actively shaping demand by offering
   few and narrow choices vs. responding to it.

   Steve Reece: Are there no female characters in those films? Male
   character sell by far most toys…

   Me: Black Widow practically airbrushed from most Avengers merchandise;
   same with Leia and Star Wars. And both clearly defined as ‘boys’ brands
   by licensees and retailers, therefore excluding girls

   Steve Reece: Commercial reality = if paying major license fees toy
   companies want every product that will sell.

   Me: In the meantime, risk averse toy companies are excluding girls.
   Where’s the child development in that?

   Steve Reece: Hard to stay in biz if don’t sell products made…no child
   development then?

   Me: ICYMI – “Opportunist commentators have jumped on this bandwagon to
   blow their own trumpets, and… advance their own ends.” Nice Steve
   Reece.

   Steve Reece: Demonising toy industry which positively contributes to
   development of billions of kids globally, for supplying demand. Also
   nice.

   Me: What’s positive for girls who think science sets, doctors kits, or
   toolboxes are for boys – because they’re not pink? Not just toy
   industry – clothes, books, magazines, it’s a problem with most things
   being sold to kids.

   Elizabeth Sweet: Clearly there is a demand for something
   different…[213]this sold out immediately.

   Me: (to Steve) I will never buy into your argument that sexism is
   justified to sell toys. Is racism too? The removal of Gamora from so
   much Guardians of the Galaxy merchandise is appalling. But you think
   that’s ok?

   And there the conversation ended, and I’m glad it did as there was
   nowhere new I was able to take it.

   Pretty depressing.

   If this is the attitude of the toy biz then we have a long way to go,
   no matter what lip service they pay to our issues with their gender
   categorisation, and screening of licensed characters by gender – such
   as the aforementioned cases of Princess Leia, Black Widow, and Gamora
   being absent from a large chunk of movie tie-ins.

   The citing of market research and of responding to consumer demand –
   without acknowledging the industry’s role in skewing those results
   through their marketing, or creating that demand – is frustrating.

   These companies choose to create products for children, which as far as
   I’m concerned means they have a responsibility to not only make a
   profit, but – at the very least – to not negatively impact our
   children’s lives. It’s not much to ask, and the two things are not
   mutually exclusive.

   And frankly, the notion that the likes of Hasbro, Mattel, or Disney
   might go out of business if they and retailers sorted and labelled toys
   by type or function instead of gender, is laughable.

   But these industry behemoths do need to evolve their offering, for
   their own sake. Take Barbie, the queen of the pink aisle. Her global
   sales have [214]significantly dropped in four of the last five
   quarters, and for an even longer period in the US (about 2 years). Some
   of Mattel’s initiatives, like [215]the Barbie Project are interesting.
   Others, like putting her on the cover of a [216]Sports Illustrated
   Swimsuit Edition, are troubling.

   However, if the choice really is as Steve Reece claims, between these
   companies survival or our children’s positive development, then I’ll
   happily wave bye bye to Optimus, Mickey, and Barbie.

   The toy industry’s ability to generate profit does not supersede our
   children’s rights to grow up without having profit-motivated limits
   placed on their imaginations, aspirations, and ambitions. But there is
   no reason the removal of these limits and the industry’s profits cannot
   happily co-exist. If anything, it will become necessary for both
   parties to flourish.

   ===============

   Oh, for another perspective on this issue, please read [217]this
   excellent post from someone who is at the frontline of all this –
   working at a toy shop! His point is a very perceptive one that has lead
   me to question how I would shop as a parent in this situation.

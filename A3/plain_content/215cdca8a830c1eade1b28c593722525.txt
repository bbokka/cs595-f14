[13]Oleander: Poisonous and Kind of a Dick

   Posted on [14]September 24, 2014 by [15]Justin • [16]Leave a comment

   A mystery writer friend asked me about oleander, the evergreen shrub
   that thrives throughout the southern United States, a little while
   back. Being the smart-ass that I am, I asked her who she was planning
   to kill and she said a dog. What, what, what? Relax, it’s a dog in the
   mystery novel she’s writing. …

[19]A Scientist Stole my Root Beer

   Posted on [20]September 17, 2014 by [21]Justin • [22]21 Comments

   I’m not ashamed to say that I like root beer. There’s something about
   the herbal and woodsy flavors that I enjoy. It’s refreshing, but also a
   time machine. A sip of root beer brings me back to my childhood and
   makes me feel like a little kid again. More so than any other drink, it
   is classic … [23]Continue reading →

[26]Wild Ginger: It’s Wild, Not Exactly Ginger, and Potentially Deadly

   Posted on [27]September 10, 2014 by [28]Justin • [29]3 Comments

   A while back I was happy to report that the Death Cap mushroom was
   aptly named, in contrast to so many things in life. Unfortunately,
   “wild ginger” is not such a plant. With a name like that you would
   suspect it to be related to commercialized ginger, but alas it’s not.
   And while the smell … [30]Continue reading →

[33]Chile Peppers: The History and Science Behind the Fiery Foods we Love

   Posted on [34]September 3, 2014 by [35]Justin • [36]7 Comments

   I love chile peppers and spicy food. I grow up to a dozen varieties of
   chile peppers each year, and turn the fruits into sauces, spreads, and
   salsas. For me, nothing tastes better than fresh homemade salsa, a few
   dashes of my Tabasco-style sauce, or fresh Thai chiles in my Pad Kra
   Pao. And I’m … [37]Continue reading →

[40]Nature’s Not Just Poisonous, She’s Sharp and Wants to Hurt You Too

   Posted on [41]August 26, 2014 by [42]Justin • [43]7 Comments

   It’s no surprise that Nature has it in for us, I write about Natures’s
   poison, toxins, and venoms once or twice a week. In a surprise move,
   I’m not going to talk about poisons today. Instead I thought I’d
   showcase Nature’s Plan-B: sharp and pointy things. Note: In all
   honesty, I really just wanted an … [44]Continue reading →

[47]The Death Cap Mushroom . . . It’s as Bad as it Sounds

   Posted on [48]August 20, 2014 by [49]Justin • [50]2 Comments

   A lot of things in life don’t make sense, and it seems I spend half my
   time trying to explain and rationalize these to my three young girls.
   They ask a lot of questions.  A lot. Why do we park on a driveway? Why
   is something called a “free gift”, aren’t gifts always free? What’s …

[54]Gelsemium and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Self-Poisoner

   Posted on [55]August 12, 2014 by [56]Justin • [57]3 Comments

   Before there was Sherlock Holmes and his trademark deerstalker cap,
   there was an English physician, Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle. And before that
   there was just plain old Arthur Conan Doyle, a student at the
   University of Edinburgh Medical School, and where we will begin. On
   September 20th, 1879 the British Medical Journal published a letter
   entitled “Gelseminum as … [58]Continue reading →

[61]How to Treat a Broken Heart, or Poison Your Lover, with Foxglove

   Posted on [62]August 5, 2014 by [63]Justin • [64]7 Comments

   “The use of foxglove is getting abroad, and it is better the world
   should derive some instruction, however imperfect, from my experience,
   than that the lives of men should be hazarded by unguarded exhibition,
   or that a medicine of so much efficacy should be condemned and rejected
   as dangerous and unmanageable” This is from the … [65]Continue reading

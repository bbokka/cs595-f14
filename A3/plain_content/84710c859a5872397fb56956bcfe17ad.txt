     *   [hp_tab1_featured.png]     Red bananas should have a deep red or
       maroon rind when ripe, and are best eaten when unbruised and
       slightly soft. The darker the fruit, the more carotene and the
       higher the vitamin C level. [27]RAINBOW FRUIT SALAD [28]NUTRITIONAL

       contains 50% of the
       recommended
       daily value of
       Vitamin C.

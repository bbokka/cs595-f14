[14]BPD Explained

   [15]Leave a reply

   I have spoken before about my personal experiences with Borderline
   Personality Disorder (BPD) [16]here and [17]here.  There are no two
   alike experiences of BPD.  Sure, there are similarities but each person
   expresses the diagnostic criteria of BPD in their own unique way.

   [18]bpd Generally, a person must present with at least five (5) of the
   diagnostic criteria for a period of two weeks or more in order to
   receive a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder.  They are also
   over the age of 18.

   I accessed the list of symptoms from [19]Psych Central, however the
   explanation with each criteria is in my own words.
    1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.  This can
       often present itself to other people as manipulation due to the
       extreme emotional response.  However the person has usually been
       abandoned by someone close to them in their formative years and is
       hyper sensitive to anything that they deem as someone leaving
       them.  This behaviour often results in the person leaving because
       they are unable to deal with the emotional outbursts.
    2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships.
       This is where the term for people with BPD of ‘I hate you don’t
       leave me’ comes from.  There is generally no in between with their
       feelings for a person.  A person with BPD will go from thinking
       that person is the best person they have ever met, to wishing that
       they were dead.  There is no grey area.
    3. Identity disturbance.  This is the inability for the person with
       BPD to see themselves as an individual and how they fit in the
       world.  They may also be unable to determine their sexuality, which
       then exacerbates other symptoms of the illness.  The person with
       BPD may then also go through many changes of their outward self in
       order to find who they are.
    4. Impulsivity and self harming behaviours.  This is different to
       suicidal ideation.  These behaviours include risky sex,
       cutting/burning of the body, binging/restricting, and spending
       money recklessly.  Usually different self damaging behaviours rear
       their head, depending on what the person is able to access and the
       stress factors involved.
    5. Recurrent suicidal behaviour.  This includes suicidal thoughts as
       well as attempting to take their own life.  This behaviour is often
       labeled as attention seeking, however it is usually as a result of
       the person feeling overwhelmed by the intense emotional turmoil.
    6. Emotional instability.  Marsha Linehan, the Doctor behind the
       development of DBT, who also admitted that she has been diagnosed
       with BPD, has been quoted as saying that ‘People with BPD are like
       people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies.  Lacking
       emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or
       movement’.  The intense reactive nature of their moods though
       generally last a few hours and rarely more than a week.  However
       these unstable mood patterns tend to cycle through extremely
       quickly, making the sufferer feel that they are in a constant mood
       state.
    7. Chronic feelings of emptiness.  This is the feeling of nothing.
       Nothing can cheer you up, nothing can make you feel worse.
       Everything is a non event.  These feelings of emptiness often lead
       the person with BPD to resort to self harming behaviours in order
       to feel something.
    8. Inappropriate, intense anger.  Anger on it’s own is not something
       that is inappropriate, however a person with BPD often has extreme
       outbursts that don’t match the trigger.  They often appear
       antagonistic and often have a hair trigger for extreme outbursts of
       anger.
    9. Transient, stress related paranoid thoughts.  It is a little known
       fact about BPD, but the Borderline of the name actually means that
       they person is ‘on the borderline’ between psychosis and neurosis.
       This means that the symptoms, like stress related paranoid thoughts
       rarely last long enough to warrant a separate diagnosis.  These
       paranoid thoughts are often in response to feelings of being
       abandoned and it is thought that through the return of this person,
       or self soothing, these thoughts will quickly cease.

   Each person will have a different presentation of these symptoms and
   the make up of these symptoms can also change throughout a persons
   life.  Once thought of as a diagnosis that was hopeless, BPD, through
   the development of DBT is no longer a psychiatric death sentence.

   However there is still a lot of stigma around BPD, both in the wider
   community and even amongst those who are supposed to be helping us.  It
   is my hope that by continuing to speak out about this treatment and
   about the realities of my day to day life, I can help to reduce this
   stigma.

   If you or someone you know is exhibiting these behaviours then I urge
   you to contact your GP to arrange an appointment with a psychiatrist.
   There is treatment, it’s hard, but it’s so worth it.

[28]The Last Laugh Part 2

   Did she just hear right?  Did he just ask her to leave with him?  Her
   heart rate quickened again.  At this rate she was sure he would be able
   to see the blood pulsing through her veins.  She worried about saying
   something stupid so she simply nodded and followed him out of the
   room.  She pinched her arm to make sure she wasn’t dreaming.  The sharp
   sting proved this was really happening.

   The cafe, as it turned out, was the one that she had spent her lunch
   hour at every day for the last 20 years.  She had never seen him it,
   she wondered if maybe he was bluffing about knowing the place.  She
   started to feel hot.  What if this was all a set up, some workplace bet
   designed to humiliate her.  She had never been popular but she hoped
   that they wouldn’t stoop to that level, not on her last day.

   There weren’t many people in the cafe when they walked in.  There was a
   few couples and some students, no doubt taking advantage of the wifi
   access given to all customers.  Towards the back there was a table in
   the corner which she liked to sit at because it gave her a view of the
   rest of the cafe.

   A waitress came to take their order and she watched him flirt with her
   as she wrote in her little note pad.  She wondered if she could ever be
   with someone who flirted so easily with other women.  The waitress must
   have said something funny because all of a sudden the room was filled
   with a guffawing that can only be likened to a baby seal trying to find
   it’s mother.

   She stared at him in stunned silence.  The waitress pulled on her
   uniform uncomfortably, obviously looking for a way out.  It was the
   breaking point.  How could a man so handsome, with a voice so
   beautifully deep, produce a noise like that?  She needed an excuse and
   she needed one fast.

   From the depths of her bag she heard a ping.  She knew that it was
   probably just a notification for the new online game she was playing,
   but he didn’t need to know that.  She had found her out and she was
   going going to take the opportunity with two hands.  She sat and stared
   at the screen of her mobile, hoping that it would catch his attention.

   It worked, and he asked her if everything was ok.  She looked at him,
   in what she hoped was an apologetic way, and said that she was sorry
   but something had come up and she needed to leave immediately.  She
   grabbed her things and left before he could say another thing, for fear
   that she would lose her nerve.

   Once she was home, she lay in bed and thought about the time she had
   wasted fawning over him.  The man with the seal laugh.  It was her deal
   breaker, there was nothing she could do about it.  Nothing at all.  Or
   could she?

[34]Hat Day 2014: Join in!

   [35]3 Replies

   This year Australian Rotary Health has created the fun idea of Hat Day
   to help raise money for mental health research in Australia.  Currently
   they are the largest non government contributor to mental health
   research in Australia but they can’t do that without your help!

   [36]Hat Day 2014 1 in 5 Australians will experience some form of mental
   illness in their lives.  That’s a massive 20% of the population.  The
   World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 mental illness will be
   the leading cause of disability in the developed world.  So we need to
   get in front of this now by helping to make sure that research has the
   funds to continue their great work.

   Currently the government is cutting more and more funding to community
   mental health organistions.  It will be up to non government entities
   like Australian Rotary Health to help keep up the support for the
   mentally ill.  There is already massive gaps between crisis care and
   long term management, we can’t allow those gaps to widen.

   Hat Day 2014 is a simple, fun way to help promote mental health and
   it’s need for funding.  All you have to do is wear a hat on Friday the
   10th of October and donate!  It really is that simple.  Also 100% of
   the proceeds from Hat Day 2014 will go towards research to help those
   affected by a variety of mental illness.

How do I get involved in Hat Day 2014?

     * Sign up [37]here to register your Hat Day FUNdraiser on 10th of
       October 2014.
     * Invite your friends, family or work colleagues to join in by
       wearing a hat.
     * Donate!

   I’ve created an [38]online party if you want to join Hat Day 2014
   without having to leave the comfort of your own home.  Make sure you
   tag me if you upload a picture to Instagram @misguidedmuser

   You can also stay up to date with everything Hat Day 2014 on
   [39]Facebook, [40]Twitter.  If you take a picture of you with your hat
   then be sure to use the hashtag #hatday14 when you post it on social
   media.

   Most importantly though…start the conversation about mental health with
   someone today!

[47]Anger: The Mask Unveiled

   [48]2 Replies

   Last week I read this [49]post by Dorothy (she’s really writing some
   awesome stuff at the moment!) on Anger.  It really hit home with me
   because anger has become my default emotion recently.  It used to
   simmer under the surface, now it bursts out before I can get a handle
   on it.

   [50]anger I had always put my anger down to circumstances, I had a
   right to be angry at the injustice that I was feeling.  Anger has
   become so much more than that over the last three or so years.  At
   first I still put it down to circumstances, I had a lot going on, I was
   right to be angry about it.  Right?

   One thing that my psychologist has reiterated to me over and over again
   in the time that I have been seeing her is that all emotions have their
   place.  Even the ones we see as negative serve as a warning signal for
   us that something is not right.  These emotions however don’t serve a
   purpose beyond that, and that is where I run into trouble.

   I was using anger as a mask, as is so common with people who have
   troubles with anger.  The anger acts as a distraction, so that the real
   issue doesn’t show it’s ugly head to the people around me.  Of course
   the anger causes issues all on its own.

   A few months ago I was writing a [51]short story, and it was only when
   I got to the end that I realised that the story was about me.  My
   readers were much more intuitive and picked it up much sooner than I
   did.  That short story was a turning point for me.  It was the point
   where I realised that anger was much less of the real issue for me.

   I was using anger to mask the anxiety that I was feeling.  The feeling
   of being judged by the people around me, the people who really didn’t
   know me at all because they were faces in the crowd.  I felt it easier
   to be on guard, ready to snap at a moments notice than to own up to the
   anxiety I was feeling.  How wrong I was.

   Owning up the feelings hasn’t magically made it better, but it has
   meant that I can begin to work on it therapy.  It’s going to be a hard
   process, I know that it won’t just disappear forever and that like all
   things I will have to work hard to keep on top of it.  However I want
   to see an end to the anger.  I want to see an end to the lava that is
   just waiting under the surface.

   Do you struggle with anger?  What have you done to help stay on top of
   it?

[60]Why I blog about mental health

   [61]Leave a reply

   It’s the first of October, the first of a month long dedication to all
   things mental illness.  As with all things, the best place to start is
   the beginning.  For me the beginning is why I choose to talk so openly
   about mental illness.

   [62]Why I blog I first started this blog in April 2011, at the time I
   wasn’t even sure if I would continue on with this blog.  I figured that
   I would bang out a couple of posts, get bored and then give up.  I
   wasn’t banking on falling in love with the online space, of having my
   voice heard.  I realised that I had an important story to share.

   Over the last three and a half years I have definitely had my fair
   share of doubts about whether I could continue this space.  I had my
   biggest identity crisis last year after Problogger because I wasn’t
   sure where I could go with my story.  I was feeling boxed in by the
   mental illness tag and I was worried that the blog was exasperating my
   illness rather than being a help.

   It was then that I first realised that blogging was about my voice, not
   just about the content and that I could write about anything I wanted.
   With that realisation, it felt like a massive weight had been lifted
   off my shoulders.  I still wanted to write about mental illness, it’s
   what I know, but I had given myself permission to not be pigeon holed
   by it.  Just like in therapy, I had come to a point where I realised
   that I was more than my mental illness.

   I’ve been dealing with my mental health issues and by extension, the
   mental health system for the last 12 years.  I have had ups and downs
   and I knew that I could use these experiences to help people.  I wanted
   people to understand what it was like to have to navigate a system that
   is flawed, a system that is almost designed to punish it’s patients
   instead of treat them.

   The thing that I most wanted from blogging, and is what keeps me going
   when I feel overwhelmed, is to educate those who still buy into the
   stigma.  I want to show the people beneath the diagnosis, to show that
   we aren’t people to be feared.  I enjoy being able to provide
   information in a way that is easy to digest.

   I hope that by telling my story, I can encourage someone else to tell
   their story.  It is only through sharing our stories that we can push
   through the stigma around mental illness.  The stigma is still rife,
   and that is why I blog about mental illness.

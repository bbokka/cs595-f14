                           [5]www.bluegrassmix.com
                       INTERVIEW for OCTOBER 04, 2014:
                                FRONT COUNTRY
   Formed in 2011 as a collective of the Bay Area's finest young acoustic
   talent, Adam Roszkiewicz, Jacob Groopman, Jordan Klein, Leif Karlstrom,
   Melody Walker and Zach Sharpe joined forces to play a monthly gig with
      friends in San Francisco's Mission District. They quickly found a
      musical rapport that was open to challenging arrangements, unigue
     covers and original songwriting. Since then they have continued to
     expand their repertoire and push the boundaries of bluegrass on the
     national scene. In 2012 they won the Rockygrass band competition in
    Colorado and followed up in 2013 with a win at Telluride becoming the
    third band in history to win both contests. Also in 2013 lead singer
   Melody Walker won the Chris Austin Songwriting competition at Merlefest
   and mandolinist Adam Roszkiewicz was nominated for Grammy for his work
        with the Modern Mandolin Quartet on their album "Americana".
     2013 and early 2013 has seen Front Country break onto the national
     scene with festival performances at Rockygrass, Old Settler's Music
   Festival, Wintergrass, Grass Valley Bluegrass Festival and many others
   along with headlining performances at the Great American Music Hall in
                               San Francisco.
    Listen in as they call Steve from somewhere on the road to talk about
                            their exciting music.
                       INTERVIEW for OCTOBER 11, 2014:
                                  PAT FLYNN
    Pat Flynn is a well known name, in one way or another, to music fans
         all over the world. You may recognize him as a member of a
      groundbreaking musical group, New Grass Revival, or a first-call
      Nashville recording session player, or a producer, songwriter and
   artist. In the last couple of years, Pat has found a way to combine all
      of these talents and showcase them on his latest CD releases. As
    guitarist/singer/songwriter for New Grass Revival, Flynn, along with
      Sam Bush, John Cowan, and Bela Fleck, influenced many of today's
       best-known artists while building New Grass Revival's own loyal
      audience to near cult status. Attesting to the group's continuing
      popularity and influence, Capitol-EMI Records has released a very
      special two CD New Grass Revival 20 year retrospective, entitled,
   'Grass Roots'. This historic collection features previously unreleased
                        live, TV, and studio tracks.
     During his tenure with NGR, Frets Magazine's National Readers Poll
   voted Pat as "Best Acoustic Guitarist" for five consecutive years. For
   winning 5 years in a row, Flynn was inducted into the Frets"Gallery of
           Greats" alonside Chet Atkins, Doc Watson and Tony Rice.
    Flynn has also been a session guitarist on more than 400 CD projects,
   including 32 Gold and Platinum records, as well as CMA and Grammy award
      winning projets with a wide array of top artists. Flynn wrote and
   performed on Garth Brooks' hit single "Do What You Gotta Do," which has
           recently been reissued in the new Garth Brooks box set.

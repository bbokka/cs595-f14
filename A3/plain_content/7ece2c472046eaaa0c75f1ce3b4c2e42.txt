   Hi, I'm Jenn, aka jennmoneydollars. I'm a web developer who lives in
   New Jersey on purpose and works full-time as an open web engineer at
   [1]Bocoup. When I'm not building open web apps with the coolest web
   developers and clients in the game, I'm making art with code, telling
   jokes, and getting yelled at on the Internet.

   In a past life, I was a senior front-end developer at the [2]NBA and,
   before that, taught and evaluated computer science education at
   Montclair State University – where I got my BS and MS in Computer
   Science. I'm the organizer of [3]JerseyScript, a front-end developer
   meetup based in New Jersey – one of several ventures I'm involved in to
   attract and retain more people in the web development community.

   Lately I've been focusing on making [4]8-bit art using code, teaching
   others how to use art to get people interested in programming, keeping
   90s alt rock alive, and [5]trying to help my peers take themselves a
   little less seriously.

   If you're not a recruiter and want to say hi, I'm most responsive [6]on
   twitter, and you can email me at [7]jenn@dotbiz.info or message
   jennmoneydollars on Freenode.

[7]Payers in the heart.

   [8][large.gif]
   Hello, Brand new week, no Monday blues but choose to feel refresh,
   renewed. Still counting down to the day I finish O level. Feeling a
   little stress with people asking hows my preparation for OLevel. Still
   a lot to be done with not much time left. But just gotta keep moving
   on, giving the best I can ever give.
   Was thinking what to update or share and "prayers in the heart" came to
   my mind. Sometimes I'm too sad, too down and too disappointed and have
   no words to describe it. Have you felt the same way before ? Not sure
   about You but this few days has been feeling really tired and hasn't
   gotten enough rest. Hence, words became little and kind of prayed
   everyday with little words and kept a lot in my heart. The picture
   above speaks a lot and really brought comfort to my heart.. Hope it
   does to Yours. It doesn't matter if U are a christian or not, in times
   of difficulty You can just whisper a prayer and see what God can do for
   You. Hope the picture will speak to Your heart and Be bless !
   Have a good week people ! :)

   Hi. Really to be back to the place I love : BEACH. Love the sea breeze
   as well as beach volleyball. Didn't play volleyball but played "running
   man".. Fun and great day spent with 316 Youth.
   The picture above was taken by Raine of me. Spot the rainbow ? Amazed
   when I saw the photo. It kind of reminded me of God's blessings over my
   life. His blessings is unending just like the water showering me and
   the rainbow kind of reminded me of God's goodness and He is always with
   me. What a great comfort.. Hope You receive this same comfort when You
   look at this Picture :)
   Resting brings blessings. Before monday come, Have a good rest people
   :)

[27]Don't forget who You are.

   Hi. so I kind of deleted my past post and started with a brand new one.
   Been long since I last blogged, glad to be back.
   O levels in just less than 5 months. Seriously wished that O level was
   a "yesterday" thing. Its a killer though A levels is worst but I just
   cant wait for it to past However I'm actually quite scared of
   failing... But what to do ? just gotta do the best and fight to the
   finish.
   Had a great day jamming with church friends and really happy to be back
   holding on to that microphone even though it was just for a few hours
   singing for fun. Long Long day...
   This few days one thing that really caught me thinking was Don't forget
   Who You Are. Probably I have forgotten what I used to like and enjoy
   doing or maybe I should phrase it I have stopped doing what I truly
   enjoy and have changed a little inside. Feeling of a stranger within
   me. But I wanna be who God wanna me be and I think that is the meaning
   behind Don't forget Who You Are. Don't forget What God has Called You
   to be probably. Hopefully this feeling of having a stranger in me would
   soon go away and i would realise that it is not a stranger but God
   shaping me.
   I'm finishing the book " Becoming myself : embracing God's dream for
   You".. It was a good read. Cant wait to start the new one.
   This is one of the song that I have been listening to. Hope it blesses
   Your heart.

   LOVE IS HERE

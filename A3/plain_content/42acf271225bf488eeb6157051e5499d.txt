[6]World Cup 2014 … Asian telcos & cable operators … between a Rock & a
Hard Place

   Asian telecommunication companies (telcos) have long enjoyed
   oligopolistic hold in their respective markets in the past 2 decades
   when Asians found their love with mobile phones, internet broadband &
   cable TV. From the normalised (adjusted to USD) chart above
   (encompassing Singapore, Malaysia & Hong Kong telcos & cable
   operators), since the 2008 financial crisis, they have managed to
   performed very well indeed given their phenomenally stable earnings &
   relatively high dividend yields averaging 2.5 – 5% in general.

   However, all good things must come to an end, sometimes it is some
   disruptive technological change or advance that renders certain
   businesses and processes obsolete. We have seen that with the steam
   locomotive, polaroid instant snaps, Xerox copiers, pagers, … the list
   goes on.  The roll-out of 3G-4G networks and fast breakneck fibre
   broadbands across Asia encouraged the growth of social media,
   peer-to-peer streaming & other usage of applications that are able to
   harness the tremendous speed & connectivity into the last mile into
   Asian consumers’ homes & even when they are on the move.  However, the
   country / domicile walls that these oligopolistic Asian telcos & cable
   operators have enacted in the past with their respective government
   support are crumbling down fast!

   The key is that there are serious dearth of unique domestic content &
   services provided by all these Asian telcos & cable operators. Most
   contents, apps and media come from the West or recently from China,
   Korea & Japan that all the Asian operators syndicated, bought or
   licensed from.  This extends to the current FIFA 2014 World Cup that
   has enthralled all viewers around the world.  The ridiculous price that
   Singapore football fans have to endure to watch the World Cup matches
   [17]http://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/3880/singapore/2014/03/18/4690244/si
   ngapore-costliest-place-to-watch-world-cup is a case study of what has
   gone wrong in ”paying based on where you happen to live” when it can be
   free or much cheaper even within other Asian countries.

   Asianmacro has been using a VPN service so that he can simply be in the
   USA, UK, Europe, Latin America or any other country he fancies as
   identified by his IP address & gateway / DNS to provide security for
   his online activities.  The fringe benefit to this is I have access to
   watch all the FIFA 2014 World Cup matches for free in those countries
   that provide free viewing to residents in them too (where Asianmacro
   will be simply be there by choosing to be there online)!

   I have taken profit on my long position in Asian telcos like Singtel
   recently.  While I am not going short these stocks as they pay
   relatively high dividends that many yield hungry investors do chase,
   the question that we should be asking is whether Asian telcos really
   have a future besides being “dumb pipe” gateway providers in
   communications & media, without any real innovative apps or unique
   domestic content that people want & will pay for!

   P.S. And asking Whatsapp or Skype to pay for using its network by
   Singtel’s CEO is definitely not the way to
   go![18] http://www.techgoondu.com/2014/02/26/commentary-singtel-wants-w

[20]Call me a lunatic … calling a short term market top

   Posted in [21]Equities, [22]Financial Markets, [23]Social Political
   with tags [24]FIFA2014 World Cup, [25]Full Moon, [26]Lunar cycle
   trading, [27]Lunar phase on June 11, 2014 by Asianmacro

   [28]Image

   Asianmacro had previously called for a continuous rally in S&P500 when
   it was at 1880 around May 24 and it has advanced almost 4% since
   [29]http://asianmacro.com/2014/05/24/path-of-least-resistance-is-up/.
   Back in May, many doomsayers were on CNBC and various media calling for
   an impending collapse of even 10-15% in stocks. But looks like  the
   shorts and underweights in equities and bonds were all forced to
   scramble and had to catch up with their benchmarks that they are
   underperforming against.

   However with the impending Full Moon on June 13 and the onset of the
   FIFA2014 World Cup, I am now calling for caution. Generally, stocks
   tend to perform better in the days around the New Moon, while price
   weakness is often seen in the days around Full Moon as seen in the
   chart above. Many research have touched upon this topic like this
   here [30]http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=281665 and
   an example of lunar-cycle trading by other traders can be found
   here [31]http://lunatictrader.com/?Moon_Cycles:Lunar_Phases and[32] htt
   p://www.ftsefreedom.com/2012/08/how-moon-affects-trader-sentiment-and.h
   tml.

   However, another indicator which is the USA Federal Reserve Money
   Supply M2 yoy growth that I track to give me an idea of the pace of
   liquidity creation in the US monetary system.  It has peaked in 2012 in
   spite of further QE which has propelled the equity markets higher.  M2
   in itself don’t mean much but belongs to an array of economic & other
   market indicators which I track. While we might see S&P500 ending
   higher and maybe even cross 2,000 level by December 2014.  But
   Asianmacro will take his chips off the table for now, pour himself a
   glass of nice burgundy, followed by a fabulous single malt whisky and
   watch the FIFA2014 World Cup action unfold.  The market is now left to
   the losers who need to be around. Not me!

[35]Waiting with bated breath for Thursday ECB meeting

   Posted in [36]Currencies, [37]Financial Markets, [38]Geo Political with
   tags [39]Draghi, [40]ECB, [41]EUR, [42]IMM CFTC on June 2, 2014 by
   Asianmacro

   [43]Image

   Asianmacro has many close friends in the ”real world” i.e. people who
   are engaged in real productive businesses or employment like doctors,
   engineers, businessmen, lawyers (OK maybe not lawyers) …. where FOMC.
   ECB, QE & other financial lingo don’t mean much to them! However, what
   you do not know nor care in your regular life in going for work in the
   morning at 9 a.m., punching out at 5 p.m. (if there is even regular
   hours anymore like days of old!) does not mean that you will not be
   affected by events & developments which only financial market
   practitioners care about to monitor with a hawk eye.

   In fact since the 2008 global financial crisis, everything that has
   happened especially in the real world & economy affecting many lives
   can be traced back to financial markets development & actions taken by
   governments & central banks since.

   The most important event coming up with reverberating effects globally
   with be this upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday 5
   May.  All expectations are on Draghi, the ECB President to cut Eurozone
   refinance rate and unleash their version of QE as well.
   [44]http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/02/us-markets-forex-idUSKBN0
   EA11M20140602 . From the chart above, we can see that EUR/USD has
   plunged from 1.40 to 1.36 currently in the past one over week end May
   as short positions (*best captured by the IMM CFTC net non-commercial
   positions) reached the highest level of shorts in 2014. Risk reversals
   volatility prices (where price of calls over puts) have fallen as well
   with options market pricing more demand for EUR puts over calls.

   In the chart below, in fact, Citigroup Pain Index is at an extreme
   negative level. This is a FX Positioning Alert Indicator that infer
   positioning of active currency traders from relationships between
   exchange rates and currency managers’ returns. A positive reading
   suggests that currency traders have been net long the currency and a
   negative reading suggests that currency traders have been net short the
   currency, and in this case, the market is extremely short EUR.

   We can also see that the yield spread between 2-year EUR rates & USD
   rates have gone to an extreme level since EUR rates fell a lot more &
   quicker in the recent weeks vis-a-vis USD rates.

   [45]Image

   When the entire sell-side screams for lower EUR & for further short EUR
   recommendations into ECB meeting, this is when Asianmacro gets worried
   over the imbalance of sentiments. Sometimes, the markets have no logic
   beyond street positioning & will go to the maximum pain to squeeze out
   the weak hands. As such, I have close out my short EUR/USD position &
   in fact turned long via 3-day EUR 1.3600 strike call options NY cut
   expiry (NYC 10 a.m. expiry which is right after ECB meeting decision &
   when the ECB press conference is underway). From illustration below, it
   cost my only 33 b.p. (or an equivalent of 40 pips in FX terms) with
   breakeven at 1.3640. If Draghi underwhelms in delivering an ECB cut &
   tone in his press conference, EUR/USD might just fly up to
   1.3750-1.3800 level and I will be a happy man via my options & allow me
   to re-sell EUR/USD to take profit & establish new EUR shorts if it make
   sense again. If ECB overwhelms with aggressive cut & dovish undertones
   & EUR/USD plunge further, I don’t lose much beyond my small option
   premium for the call option that will expire worthless.

[48]Path of least resistance is … UP!

   Posted in [49]Currencies, [50]Equities, [51]Financial Markets,
   [52]Volatility, Gamma & Greeks with tags [53]EEM, [54]EUR/AUD, [55]SPY,
   [56]VIX on May 24, 2014 by Asianmacro

   [57]Image

   There have been many naysayers & dooms -day-prophets in the markets
   lately. It’s always easy to call for a 10-20% correction in stocks &
   general markets & saying ‘Sell in May & go away!”.  The key is when
   precisely? And also after all the selling in protecting your downside
   if you cannot take the temporary marked-to-market pain; when & how are
   you going to get back onto the financial market bus before it speeds
   off again without you is key!

   Sometimes when everybody call for a market correction or move in either
   direction up or down, usually, it just ain’t gonna happen that way.
   Just like the past week when calls of 1815 or 1780 in S&P500, a 5%
   correction to the downside seems imminent … we end up at almost 1900 by
   the end of the week.

   Asianmacro likes to look at relative performance of EEM vs SPY (the
   Emerging Market ETF vs S&P500 ETF) as an indicator of flow of funds
   between developed & emerging markets whenever the direction of the
   general market is uncertain. From the chart above, we see that SPY has
   outperformed EEM since 2010 till January 2014 when it reversed. The
   biggest components of EEM are the likes of Samsung Electronics (3.93%),
   Taiwan Semiconductor (2.50%), Tencent (1.88%), China Mobile (1.55%),
   China Construction Bank (1.31%); where the top 5 names account for
   about 11% weighting & all are from North Asia.

   From the chart below, new units creation in EEM have been driving the
   rally outperformance of EEM evidently. The question now is will we see
   this continue or we might have plateaued & reverse instead?

   [58]Image

   It does seem that in the short run, perhaps we just might especially if
   China is relaxing the foreign investment
   rules [59]http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303749904
   579579670989773760?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farti
   cle%2FSB10001424052702303749904579579670989773760.html. In addition,
   EUR/AUD FX cross continues to head lower with VIX and all signs do
   point to S&P500 crossing & powering higher above 1900 despite the howls
   of protests by the bears that was touched upon in my previous post on a
   summer melt-up rally in risky
   assets[60] https://asianmacro.com/2014/05/13/the-summer-carry-melt-up-i
   n-risk-assets/.

   Remember, the path of least resistance is … UP … as this is when it’s
   most painful for everybody who’s gotten off the financial market bus &
   have not got back in again!

[62]Full moon reversal & doing nothing .. football might save the world

   Posted in [63]Equities, [64]Financial Markets, [65]Lifestyle &
   Entertainment, [66]Social Political, [67]Volatility, Gamma & Greeks
   with tags [68]Full Moon, [69]VIX, [70]Volatility on May 15, 2014 by
   Asianmacro

   IFRAME:
   [71]http://www.youtube.com/embed/EC-zB2aSXXM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&shows
   earch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   It was a full moon last night on 14 May 2014 & usually more often than
   not, it signals a short term market top or reversal especially in
   equities. We did see an intraday high where S&P500 pushed above 1900
   before reversing lower. It does not mean that we do not get a potential
   summer rally squeeze in risky
   assets [72]http://asianmacro.com/2014/05/13/the-summer-carry-melt-up-in
   -risk-assets/ as we are not into summer yet but just knocking the door
   around the corner.

   However, it does bring to mind the uncertainty & sense of not knowing
   what to do on certain days with conviction especially by the humble
   Asianmacro here who is only a small minion in the big scheme of things
   in the financial markets. The only thing that made sense is the video
   clip produced by Samsung assembling some of the best footballers on
   Earth to save us from an Alien invasion where the outcome is determined
   by a football match .. what else is new!

   [73]Image

   From the chart above, if you look at the spread between the 1st & 2nd
   VIX futures contract, we are back again to 155 b.p. difference. Usually
   a big & growing difference where the 2nd contract value is greater than
   the 1st contract value implies an upward sloping volatility curve (for
   VIX) & represent a normalisation of sentiment (or complacency).  A
   small or narrowing difference and in the extreme when it goes to
   negative value implies an inverted volatility curve (for VIX) where
   heightened fear of imminent risk of crash in markets resulted in buying
   of volatility (or VIX) in near contract over that of far contracts.

   The above is just a generalisation so as not to bore most of you who
   might not be equity derivatives & volatility traders. However, as you
   can see above, whenever we reach 155-175 b.p. spread in VIX 1st & 2nd
   futures, we do see a correction lower in S&P500 subsequently for a
   short period of time.  Anyway, there are just so many mixed signals in
   the markets at the moment. Sometimes it’s best to just sit back on the
   sidelines & wait …

   “The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions
   is responsible for many losses on Wall Street even among the
   professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day,
   as though they were working for regular wages.” – Jesse Livermore

[75]FIFA14 World Cup and financial markets

   Posted in [76]Equities, [77]Financial Markets, [78]Social Political
   with tags [79]Algos, [80]FIFA14 World Cup, [81]HFT on May 14, 2014 by
   Asianmacro

   [82]Image

   Football, rugby, cricket, baseball, (*OK American football & Aussie
   rules football too just to be inclusive) are popular sports with most
   in the global financial markets. With the impending FIFA14 World Cup
   upon us in summer, what will happen to the traders & portfolio managers
   in banks, hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds & insurance
   companies? Short of abandoning their posts, their attention will be on
   the TV in the dealing room playing that match while they root for their
   teams.  Only the algos running the HFTs machines will continue to do
   their work unfailingly!

   There have been many research done in the recent past to suggest
   anaemic volumes in stock markets & also of declines when a country
   loses a
   game [83]http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/01/29/world-cup-losses-trigger-stoc
   k-market-drop/.  Even the venerable ECB had done a study on it
   before[84] http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/story/_/id/7573861/stock-ma
   rket-trading-slows-world-cup-study-says as reported & the actual study
   can be seen
   here [85]http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1424.pdf.

   However, this FIFA14 World Cup fever does increases the likelihood of
   the potential path of least resistance .. which is for a higher stock
   market & in risky assets in general as uninvolved cash on the
   sidelines, cautious traders & portfolio managers failed to invest &
   tracked the grinding higher markets. Perhaps, the silent algos in HFTs
   who do not watch any FIFA14 World Cup matches might get it right &
   actually be the culprits pushing & buying the markets even higher from
   here!

[87]The summer carry melt-up in risk assets

   Posted in [88]Currencies, [89]Equities, [90]Financial Markets,
   [91]Volatility, Gamma & Greeks with tags [92]EUR/AUD, [93]FX carry,
   [94]VIX on May 13, 2014 by Asianmacro

   [95]Image

   The hardest trade to put on mentally & physically in execution more
   often than not ends up being the right profitable trade. This was
   learnt the hard way by Asianmacro over the years like when overnight &
   tomorrow/next Thai-baht (THB) rate was at 10% at mid-day at the onset
   on the Asian crisis in May 1997, when it was only 3% in the morning, it
   still made sense to pay up to secure any funding if you really need
   them. It ended up at 1,000% by late afternoon & everything keeled over.

   There is a sense of deja-vu at the moment except that this time instead
   of the markets keeling over, there seems to be a slow motion melt-up in
   risk assets led by U.S. stock markets with S&P500 leading the way while
   Nasdaq100 & Russell2000 recovered from their respective corrections
   over the recent weeks.

   From the chart above, where both the EUR/AUD FX cross & VIX bear high
   correlation & R-square with each other.  Everything seems to suggest
   with declining VIX and a continued search for FX carry best represented
   by EUR/AUD shorts (to earn the interest rate differential between EUR &
   AUD) … the pain trade is to see risky assets melt up even more into
   summer!

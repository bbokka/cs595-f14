Brigida Mack

   Brigida Mack is an award-winning anchor/reporter for WBTV News in
   Charlotte. A native of the Queen City, she joined Channel 3 in August
   of 2009.

   She co-anchors the station's top-rated afternoon newscast, First at
   4:00, with Jamie Boll.  In March 2014, Brigida began anchoring
   full-time at WBTV with the addition of its primetime eight o'clock show
   on sister channel, Bounce TV. She co-anchors the hour-long show
   alongside Delano Little.  A fun and eclectic mix of news, in-depth look
   at community events, pop culture and sports, Brigida is excited about
   this new role.

   She began her career as a weekend anchor in Charlottesville, VA. Over
   her nearly 12 year career, Brigida has covered the Virginia Tech
   shootings, interviewed former President Jimmy Carter, actress and
   Autism spokesperson, Sissy Spacek as well as several well-known
   comedians and celebrities. She has also covered her a number of
   hurricanes including Isabel and Frances, in addition to an  earthquake
   in Central Virginia!

   Brigida is a proud alumna the University of North Carolina at Chapel
   Hill , where she holds a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism. She also
   graduated from Myers Park High School -- Go Mustangs!

   The N.C. Associated Press honored Brigida in 2012 when she won its
   "Best Series" award for her heart-warming series, "Pass 3 On." She was
   also nominated for an Emmy in 2004 for team coverage of Hurricane
   Frances. Creative Loafing's readers voted her "Best Local TV Reporter",
   in the magazine's "Best of Charlotte" Awards for four consecutive
   years, from 2005-2008 and again in 2010. She is also member of the
   National Association of Black Journalists.

   Brigida is also passionate about health and fitness. In 2013, she
   courageously shared her journey to live a healthier lifestyle and her
   "[97]TeamNOSugar" campaign went global with followers as far away as
   Denmark!  She lost nearly 50 lbs over the course of a year by giving up
   processed sugars. She continues to work toward her health and fitness
   goals while inspiring and encouraging others to live a healthy
   lifestyle through her blog.

   When Brigida is not being a news junkie or working out, she enjoys
   traveling, reading and cheering on her beloved Tar Heels!

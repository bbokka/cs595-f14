[9]You Can Be Doing Good, But Not Better Than Me

   Posted on [10]September 30, 2014 by [11]yooooojp — [12]Leave a comment

   Oh, yeah! I am on a roll today! Let’s get it!

   How come some black Americans see others doing well and get upset? Like
   it’s your fault that they are where they are. They always have
   something negative to say, or they cut their eyes at you. Why can’t we
   look at another brother or sister and say, “congrats! You doing the
   damn thing”? How are we supposed to call each other brother and sister,
   if there is so much hatred in our community? Why is it everyone else’s
   fault that they’re not doing too well in life? There is such a
   crabs-in-a-barrel mentality that runs rampant in the black community.

   During my lunch break, my dad and I walk around downtown just to get
   some fresh air. We either get harassed for money, or get mean mugs by
   our fellow “brothers”, like it’s our fault they’re on the corner.
   Instead of sitting around, get up and do something with yourself.

   It seems as if the main complaint within the black community is STILL,
   “the white man is holding me down.” Okay. Let me play devil’s advocate
   and actually use that logic. Who would hire someone that sags their
   pants down to their knees, walks around with an attitude, and doesn’t
   have an education past an 11th grade level? Instead of blaming everyone
   else, take a look in the mirror and do some self-reflecting. Stop
   thinking everyone owes you something, especially if you’re anything but
   deserving of it.

[18]The Exception

   Posted on [19]September 30, 2014 by [20]yooooojp — [21]Leave a comment

   I know, I know. It’s been a while. My bad. It’s been a mixture of
   writer’s block, forgetting about the blog site, school, working, etc.
   Whatev.

   But anyways!

   For pretty much my entire life, I have always been the “exception”. I
   was born and raised in Prince George’s County, Maryland, a majority
   black county. I was raised in a traditional two parent household. Both
   my parents worked hard to provide for my sister and I. When I was
   younger, my dad dressed me like a private school kid–you know, khakis,
   button-ups, polos, etc. I didn’t have the latest pair of sneakers, nor
   was I allowed to listen to CDs with the explicit label until I was 13.
   Whenever I came home and used slang, I was instantly corrected. I knew
   how to act at school, and how to act at home.

   Most of my friends were black, but they were like-minded. Sadly, it was
   only a few. The other kids, were just belligerent. Of course I couldn’t
   vibe with them. But even as a kid, I could tell that I didn’t fit in. I
   was always teased by other black kids for being too black. Also because
   of the way I was dressed. I’m not even gonna fake, it used to hurt.
   Like, all I wanted to do was be a kid and have fun. I couldn’t
   understand it. I have been called an “oreo” and also been told that I
   “act white”…whatever that means.

   Now at 23, I have learned to just accept myself. Took me a while,
   though. I am well-dressed, I listen to EDM, and the majority of my
   thinking is on the contrary to the normal Black American. I have a good
   head on my shoulders, with a strong conviction. I guess I’m just
   overall different from the norm. I am constantly being stared at
   amongst my black peers. I still get called “an oreo”. Am I “too white”
   for my black peers.

   Here at work, although I am dressed professionally, and equipped with
   my badge, sometimes I enter the elevator and notice that some of the
   white people still cut their eyes, mean mug, or the women would put a
   vice grip on their purses when I walk by. One lady even held her car
   key like a weapon towards my dad and I, as if she was trying to protect
   herself. Makes me wonder… Am I too black for white people?

   I already know I can’t win, and that’s okay. I don’t mind being the
   dark skinned guy that doesn’t perpetuate a lot of the stereotypes that
   are plagued in the black community. I’m just me, deal with it or…well,
   you know the rest.

[27]“The American Dream”

   Posted on [28]March 13, 2014 by [29]yooooojp — [30]Leave a comment

   Time sure does fly by quickly, doesn’t it? I mean, 10 years ago, I
   remember being excited to finally become a teenager. Fast forward to
   five years later, I graduated high school and started college. That in
   itself was surreal to me because it just happened so quickly.

   When I was 13, someone asked me, “where do you see yourself in five
   years?” I remember telling them that I see myself with a nice car,
   graduating high school, and with a nice girlfriend. Two out of three
   ain’t bad, eh? But then when I was 18, during my freshman year in
   college, someone asked me the same question: Where do you see yourself
   in five years? I responded by saying, “I’m going to have a good job, in
   my own place, living a comfortable life.” Five years later, none of
   that is going on in the present day. At 23, I’m pursuing my bachelor’s,
   still at home, and I work a slight, retail gig.

   I’m at the age now where I feel like I can conquer the world. I
   definitely embody that narcissistic, megalomaniac stereotype that the
   Generation X folk have given us. The only thing that’s stopping me from
   fully living life is the fact that I don’t have a good job yet. It is
   so difficult to find a good job. Yes, I am grateful because I have a
   job, but I’m underemployed.

   Finding a job is so difficult for us millennials. For one, employers
   require you to have 5+ years of experience for an entry level position.
   Where would a 23 year old gain that experience? Internships do get you
   some experience, but does that mean I should’ve sought after one
   straight after high school?

   Another problem is the fact that no matter what degree you have and
   regardless of your skill set, seems like you have to know someone to
   get hired by an employer. A good friend of mine told me, “who you know
   will get you the job; what you know will keep you there.” I don’t know
   how long this has been going on, but why is that the case? Why can’t I
   just live the American dream and find a job right out of college?

   I read an article on Huff Post a while back and I read that in 1980,
   most Americans had earned an average income by the time they were 26.
   These days, most Americans reach that income by the time they’re 30.
   WHAT THE F#%K?! Not to say that life was easy back in the day, but most
   of Generation X and the Boomers made a decent living coming straight
   out of high school, and a lot of them are far better off now. I wish
   that was the case these days.

   It gets discouraging because I feel like I’ll never start my life. But
   I don’t let it bring me all the way down. I try to keep hope alive.
   Sometimes the struggle gets so real, I start looking at those pyramid
   companies because I wanna get rich, quickly. But then I slap myself
   back to reality.

   I just hope one day I’ll be able to move on up in the world. Like,
   aside from school, the only two things that are on my mind right now
   are whether or not to save money for a car or my own place. I don’t
   know which I want first. But I do know one thing; the next time someone
   asks me, “where do you see yourself in five years?” I’m going to kindly
   ignore the question.

[38]Can’t Have Both

   Posted on [39]March 11, 2014 by [40]yooooojp — [41]Leave a comment

   Thinking about it now, I don’t know why I didn’t major in English. Ever
   since I could remember, I’ve always been good at writing papers. Even
   back to the grade school days when I was in Reading/Language Arts (took
   it WAY back). I remember winning spelling bees, being awarded with gold
   medals and certificates, and I was just barely 6 years old. Remember
   the TAG (Talented and Gifted) program? Remember how you had to be
   tested into the program? I couldn’t even tell you about the test
   because I didn’t have to take it. I was recommended. Yup, your boy was
   killin’ em! :) But here’s my problem. I absolutely SUCK at math. I wish
   I was one of the rare few that are good in both math and English. Talk
   about being a TAG human being.

   To be honest, I never really liked math. It is literally the pure bane
   of my existence, and its presence is still haunting me to this very
   day. Like, who’s the a**hole that sat down and thought of all this
   madness? Bored much?! But I’m not talking about the basic, everyday
   math that we apply in our lives. I’m talking about the math that we
   were introduced to in middle/high school. I feel as though unless
   you’re majoring in specific subjects, the school system shouldn’t focus
   so much on taking Geometry and Algebra II.

   The ONLY math class that I enjoyed (and that I got good grades in), was
   Business Math, in which I took in the 11th grade. That class taught me
   so much about the math that we use in our everyday lives–how to
   calculate overtime pay, taxes, the difference between gross and net,
   etc. That is the kind of math that should be required for a student to
   take before they graduate high school, not Algebra II. But I digress.

   I remember my first time finding math difficult. I was in the 2nd
   grade, and had just started the TAG program. Before the end of the
   second quarter had ended, we were starting long division. From that day
   forward, I had a deep, intense, disdain for math. I just couldn’t
   grasped the concept of it right away. It took two years for me to
   finally understand it. Throughout my tenure in grade school, I did just
   good enough to pass (and also by the grace of God).

   Fast forward into my college years. I remember taking a placement test
   my freshman year. I aced the English and writing portion, but
   completely bombed the math section. So much so, that I was in
   developmental math for quite a while. The struggle was so bad; I
   remember having a friend do my math homework while I did his Philosophy
   essay. He got a good grade on his paper, and he aced my math homework.
   Subsequently, I failed that test horribly because I didn’t know the
   material, smh. You live and you learn, eh?

   Thankfully, and again, by the grace of God, I was able to pass the
   first stage of college. Now I’m pursuing my Bachelors (no, it’s not in
   English), and I’m still facing this mathematical demon. I shall
   overcome, though.

   I think I was blessed with the ability to read and write well. Reason
   being, I didn’t read many novels as a kid and I couldn’t tell you the
   difference between a prepositional phrase and an infinitive. I am just
   a grammar freak, and I can tell you a thing or two about subject and
   verb tense agreement.

   In my life, I have noticed that friends that were good in math, sucked
   at writing papers. The friends I have that are good at math are very
   analytical, and patient. I guess you have to be a deep thinker and
   level-headed when trying to solve those outrageous problems. I plan to
   do a study as to why it’s difficult to master both subjects. I’m really
   intrigued.

   Oh, well. I’m not going to stress myself as to why I’m not good at
   something. My dad always told me I’d be a great writer. Let’s see if I
   can prove him right.

[3]Dark Nature

   It's been awhile I last visited this place, too overwhelmed by my full
   time job as an engineer now. Not to mention how tanned I got from the
   overexposure of the sun, so much for trying to stay fair. I got at
   least 3 shades darker. But oh well, such is life right?
   Recently, I got featured on [4]Afstreetstyle and I must say it was such
   a great experience. To have 2 photographers to be telling you how to
   stand and pose for them to take a shot, I feel like Miranda Kerr but
   maybe less prettier like oh my god she's not just another model in
   Victoria's Secret. I totally didn't expect them to use some big ass
   cameras for the shoot, I thought it would be just some regular DSLR
   cameras but nope, they used those long lens camera. Such commitment for
   OOTD shots really amazes me.
   I've been dressing up according to themes that I used as inspiration,
   so i usually do like black, prints or floral. For this outfit it's just
   black and floral.

   Gosh I look too round here!

    Pardon me for the gross part of the leg hair hahaha that's the worst
   guy problems ever. And this is my first ever designer pair of shoes,
   loving it too much already.

   I hope to be back here soon again, lappy is dying instantly and
   randomly lately. I'm fearing at this moment as I'm typing this
   sentence. Still figuring out how to get into the fashion industry, I
   guess I'm not doing a great job because I'm not rushing to get what I
   want. I don't see a fight in me, I need that push really. However, I'm
   keeping myself inspired by reading up fashion related magazines. Will
   be DIY-ing chokers and body harness soon, so keep a look out for it!
   Till then!

[19]Cafe Hunting At Jalan Dhoby

   Went cafe hunting over at Malaysia last week over at Jalan Dhoby, which
   was suggested by my cafe hunting company because apparently, we got
   sick of City Square and KSL which are the usual to-go places for most
   people going to Malaysia from Singapore. To be honest, there are too
   many places in Malaysia that I've yet to discover, not to mention that
   I'm born and raised there.
   Jalan Dhoby is just a 10 minutes walk away from City Square, it's known
   as the hipster street. The street itself gave me the first impression
   of Haji Lane over in Singapore, however it's more laid back. They have
   cafes that has quirky interior designs, or just filled with retro
   stuffs. The only thing you have to embrace is the intense heat from the
   sun, the recommended timing to be there will be after 4pm because
   that's when the shops start to open for business as per them?
   [20][photo+4+(5).JPG]
   Cafe Roost
   More than 90% of their interior furniture are made from old timber or
   recycled materials like paint containers, newspapers and glass bottles.

   [22][photo+5+(4).JPG]
   Inviting entrance much?
   [23][photo+5+(1).JPG]
   Chocolate chips ice blended, Caramel ice blended with chocolate chips
   and chocolate mint. Mine is caramel ice blended with extra chocolate
   chips added, I must say it's like so much better than Starbucks and it
   only costs like RM8.90??? (RM6.90 + RM2 for the chocolate chips)
   [24][photo+1+(2).JPG]
   Recycled newspaper and paint container chairs are too cool for our bum
   bum!
   [25][photo+1+(4).JPG]
   Paint tub and hanger lighting can't be much more amazing.

   Just chillin' at the bus stop.

   Pieces of cardboard glued together to form these table and chairs, but
   I don't dare to touch them fearing that they might itch me.

   [30][photo+3+(3).JPG]
   Unique display of read to keep you entertained.

   With my baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, which might used to be the moving
   riding thingy you see in shopping malls for kids.
   [36][photo+5.JPG]
   [37][photo+4.JPG]
   Smoking corner is too encouraging for smokers.
   [38][photo+2+(2).JPG]
   That half trolley tho.
   [39][photo+5+(5).JPG]
   If you see such daring signs in Malaysia, no questions, just enter.
   [40][photo+1+(5).JPG]
   I love shops that shows retro stuffs and the history behind the
   operation of their shops.
   [41][photo+2+(5).JPG]
   ROOT BEER FLOAT BEATS ANYTHING.
   [42][photo+3+(5).JPG]
   Grilled chicken chop with mushroom sauce. The potato wedges they serve
   are freshly cut, not those store bought types, they definitely show
   pride in what they serve.
   How to get there:

   Follow this map and you'll not go wrong. (Picture credits: Google)
   The cafe hunting trip was definitely fun and eye opening. Caught X-Men:
   Days Of Future Past that day too, it was alright, but Jennifer Lawrence
   as Mystique, dayummmmm! Have been doing cafe hunting these few days
   around that whole area to discover more cafes like these, more posts
   will be coming up, so stay tuned!
   Till then!

[52]Happy Things

   2014 has been reasonably smooth to me, but wow, time sure flies and now
   I'm left with only half of the year to go. 3 exciting things that made
   this year pleasant was me finally graduating, getting featured on
   [53]StyleXStyle and of course, being sponsored by [54]FoxNBadger. They
   sounds kinda small and simple, but to me, I'd say it's something.
   [55][photo.JPG]
   It means so much to me when I'm featured in social media websites, I do
   appreciate the fact that people acknowledge the effort one puts into
   their outfit. However, some people around me are less supportive of my
   dress up so I must really thank those who gave me the virtual support,
   encouragement and inspiration. It's a challenging world for me to be
   metrosexual.
   To be sponsored by [56]FoxNBadger, I mean it's just mind blowing to
   even think about it. To be honest, I went a little bonkers that day
   when the owner of the blogshop asked me. But hey, that's how anyone
   would react too! Right?
   [57][photo+%25284%2529.JPG]
   Eyebrows game on point! Yes, I'm a vainpot.
   [58][photo+%25282%2529.JPG]
   Finally got my hands on 2 pairs of creepers that are of my size, I
   bought it immediately without hesitating for one second because the
   hunt for good creepers is too tough. Sadly, they are not high enough
   for me.
   [59][SAM_0296.JPG]
   [60][SAM_0278.JPG]
   Trying something Tumblr-ish but the location is a little wrong,
   however, the toilet is so Tumblr worthy!
   [61][photo+(4).PNG]
   Would like to thank A for the make up done and K for his Tumblr-like
   house. Finally, got a full time job working as an engineer, my nemesis.
   Tried applying a few fashion related jobs but didn't manage to get it
   because they required diploma that is related to it. But oh well,
   welcome to Singapore!
   Will keep this area alive and fresh with new posts, more advertorials I
   hope!
   *Fingers crossed*
   Till then!

[70]{AD} FoxNBadger

   I'm back here with something new, a sponsored advertorial with
   [71]FoxNBadger, in their Givenchy inspired rose border tee! One can
   never go wrong with floral prints, and that makes me love them so much!
   Love the sharp and vibrant prints on the tee, and not to mention that
   it's made of lycra material, thus making you feeling all comfy! It
   comes in both black and white color too!
   What I love about FoxNBadger, personally:
   Most of their apparels are vibrant in colors or they just have an edgy
   look to it, which suits my taste pretty well. However, there's a huge
   disadvantage of being a guy here. But luckily, they are starting to
   bring in unisex apparels!

   [74][SAM_0299.JPG]

[93]Fashion Inspired Easter Eggs

    Just a little throwback to what I've done for Easter Day itself, I
   painted some pretty looking eggs that are inspired by some particular
   brands in the SS14 campaign!
    [94] [1.PNG]
   Prada, The Iconoclasts.
   [95][2.PNG]
   Céline, giant paint strokes.
   [96][3.PNG]
   Moschino, McDonald's.
   [97][photo+1.PNG]
   Kenzo, water prints.
   [98][photo+3.PNG]
   Louis Vuitton, big fonts.
   [99][photo+2.PNG]
   Just a simple illustration of [100]Willabelle, a pretty inspiring,
   sweet and adorable lady.
   [101][photo.JPG]
   On certain days, the inner Van Gogh comes out alive and I feel inspired
   to paint. Still doing my best in keeping those fashion related stuffs
   alive, working my way into the industry. Now that I've ended my
   polytechnic life, I'm quite uncertain on what's the big step to be
   next. Something efficient has to be worked out soon.
   More updates will be coming in, have been neglecting this area as I've
   been working really long hours and to be honest, I feel rather guilty
   about it. Please be patient with me and I'll show you more around.
   Till then!

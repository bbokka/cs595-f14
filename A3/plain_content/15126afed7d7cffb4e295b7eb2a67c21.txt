[13]Blessedness of Forgiveness

   [14]October 3, 2014

   Originally posted on [15]Continually Seeking Him:

   [ Blessedness of Forgiveness and of Trust in God. ] [ A Psalm of David.
   A Maskil. ] How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose
   sin is covered! — Psalm 32:1

   Have you experienced the pure blessedness of forgiveness? Have you
   called out to God and received the forgiveness of Jesus Christ that He
   freely gave for you on the cross? Do you realize the magnitude of
   having your sin covered? Freedom from shame, regret, guilt, insecurity,
   unworthiness.

   Ask for forgiveness. Experience the blessing.

   Continually seeking Him,

   Sharon

[18]Bible Verse Of The Day- “Do You Have Faith Like David?”

   [19]October 2, 2014

   How many times do we expect to receive something in faith rather than
   doubting? It’s a common feeling to doubt anything good as human beings,
   but when you are a new creature in Christ, those impossibilities,
   becomes more possible.

[24]What To Say When A Jehovah’s Witness Knocks On Your Door

   [25]September 29, 2014

   Originally posted on [26]A Transformed Individual:

   This is a fun topic for me. I was going into a store yesterday, and a
   older woman who was sitting in a car next to my truck called me back to
   give me a pamphlet. It was a older woman and what looked to be her
   daughter sitting in a car targeting certain people to give out
   pamphlets. I was dressed in some nice clothes at this time(a skirt,
   dress shirt, and some nice shoes), so they probably thought that I was
   a prime candidate for walking neighborhoods with them. I had somewhere
   to go at this time so I just grabbed it and kept on going. I did not
   realize that they were Jehovah Witnesses until I fully read the
   pamphlet. Usually, I would’ve stopped, gone back, and questioned them
   on their views and what they think about Jesus, God, and so on
   but yesterday wasn’t that day. I just didn’t have enough time…

[29]Jesus’s death & saving faith

   [30]September 27, 2014September 27, 2014

   Jesus died for our sin-
   when we sin, there is a punishment. just like when we break laws, we’d
   get punished by the government.
   the cost of sin is real. however, Jesus died as a sacrifice, so we are
   not bound to pay the penalty. but this does not mean we stop sinning,
   or that it’s ok to sin.

   as Gods son, Jesus’ death is the penalty of our sin to God, so that we
   may be free of its punishment and so be able to enter Gods kingdom and
   have a relationship with our loving and merciful Father.

   for the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life
   in Christ Jesus our Lord. – Romans 6:23

   yet it’s an exchange- we must believe it truly, have faith and
   receptance of this fact so that we may be saved by Jesus. Jesus died
   for all of us, but not all choose to receive it. some choose not to see
   the truth, and so choose not to be saved. open your eyes and heart to
   see the truth. Jesus is waiting for you.

   therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace
   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ -Romans 5:1
   “saving faith is not just believing that Jesus lived and died. faith
   that saves is the confident, continuous confession of total dependence
   on, and trust in Jesus Christ to meet the requirements on your behalf
   to give you entrance into God’s eternal kingdom. It’s the surrender of
   your life in complete trust to Him to do what you cannot do.” – John
   MacArthur

   here’s a chunk of verses that explains it as well:

   8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
   sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Since we have now been justified by his
   blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him! 10
   For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through
   the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we
   be saved through his life! 11 Not only is this so, but we also boast in
   God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received
   reconciliation.

   Romans 5:8-11

   What happens when you feel wronged? Do you give in to those negative
   thoughts and just give up?

   [43]September 21, 2014

   Waves break above your head
   Or maybe you’re six feet underground
   A dozen pills in your hand
   A dozen more in your belly
   Drip
   Drip
   Drip
   The blood– your blood is staining the carpet
   The bed
   Wandering outside of your body
   Though it should remain inside
   Feet dangling over the edge
   Sheer exhilaration
   “This is the end
   The end of everything
   No more pain
   No more suffering”

   But it’s wrong
   That voice in your head
   Your parents will wail
   Your schoolmates experience depression
   Your teachers shake their heads
   And everyone asks
   Why
   Why
   Why
   And that voice
   Yes that voice that drove you to it
   Now lives in theirs

   But it doesn’t have to be this way
   There’s nothing too big
   Too difficult
   Impossible even
   For the One who saves

   When you open your mouth
   For one last scream
   Underwater
   Oxygen invades your lungs instead
   Before you close your eyes
   For the last time
   In that deep dark underground
   A surge of power from another Source
   Pulls you to the surface
   And fresh air embraces you
   Pills become candy
   As you become a beloved child again
   Protected and loved
   The blades no longer work
   You don’t need them
   Anymore
   Anyway
   Because something else runs in you
   A joy
   A hope
   A peace that fills your soul

   And you’re pulled back
   From the brink of despair
   Into a solid
   Warm
   Chest
   A deep voice that kills
   The one in your head
   Telling you you’re loved
   You’re an overcomer
   And you’re stronger
   Way stronger than you think

   Professional Biography

   A love of learning is the ultimate gift a teacher can give her
   students. I strive to be a loyal friend and mentor to my students and
   their families. I am honored to be part of their American
   experience.  I am proud to teach in an environment where I can learn
   from the experience and wisdom of my colleagues. Their willingness to
   collaborate and their encouragement motivate me to create a magical
   learning environment for my student’s everyday – an environment that
   values and respects their efforts to learn a new language and function
   successfully in their new homes.   My colleagues, former students, and
   parents would say that my greatest contribution to education is my
   passion for inspiring my students to have fun, learn, and always do
   their best work. As a classroom teacher, my greatest contributions and
   accomplishments are directly related to the success of my students. I
   have always strived to be a reflective practitioner and lifelong
   learner. My school provides me with the tools needed to maximize my
   students’ potential.

   Strong math skills are the key to college and careers, and that math
   education deserves its due. In order to provide my students as many
   opportunities, I fully immerse myself in providing a well-rounded,
   differentiated learning environment to succeed and reach beyond what
   they think is possible. Teaching is a way I can touch the future
   through my students making them my greatest contributions and
   accomplishments.

   Personal Biography

    I am originally from India and have been teaching for the past nine
   years. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Education from Osmania
   University, Hyderabad, India. My areas of expertise include Mathematics
   and Physics. I also have a Master’s of Science in Physics from Osmania
   University. Over the past four years at Northwest Halifax High School,
   I have been teaching Algebra 1 through Pre-Calculus. Other than being a
   teacher, I’m a loving wife and a mother of handsome 4 years old Vishal.

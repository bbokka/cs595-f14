   Milton's [13]Paradise Lost c.1866

   Satan ([14]Hebrew: שָּׂטָן satan, meaning "adversary"^[15][1]) is a
   term, as well as the name of a figure appearing in the texts of the
   [16]Abrahamic religions^[17][2]^[18][3] who brings [19]evil and
   temptation, and is known as the deceiver that leads humanity astray.
   Some religious groups teach that he originated as an [20]angel who fell
   out of favor with God, seducing humanity into the ways of [21]sin, and
   who now rules over the fallen world. In the [22]Hebrew Bible and the
   [23]New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a
   decidedly malevolent entity (a.k.a. the [24]devil) who possesses
   demonic qualities.

   In [25]Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a positive force and
   deity who is either worshipped or revered. In [26]LaVeyan Satanism,
   Satan is regarded as holding virtuous characteristics.^[27][4]^[28][5]

Judaism

Hebrew Bible

   The original [47]Hebrew term, satan, is a noun from a verb meaning
   primarily to, “obstruct, oppose,” as it is found in [48]Numbers 22:22,
   [49]1 Samuel 29:4, [50]Psalms 109:6.^[51][6] Ha-Satan is traditionally
   translated as “the accuser,” or “the adversary.” The definite article
   “ha-,” English “the," is used to show that this is a title bestowed on
   a being, versus the name of a being. Thus this being would be referred
   to as “the satan.”^[52][7]

Thirteen occurrences

   Ha-Satan with the [53]definite article occurs 13 times in the
   [54]Masoretic Text, in two books of the [55]Hebrew Bible:
     * [56]Job ch.1–2 (10x),^[57][8]
     * [58]Zechariah 3:1–2 (3x).^[59][9]

   Satan without the definite article is used in 10 instances, of which
   two are translated diabolos in the Septuagint and "Satan" in the
   [60]King James Version:
     * 1 [61]Chronicles 21:1, "Satan stood up against [62]Israel" (KJV) or
       "And there standeth up an adversary against Israel" ([63]Young's
       Literal Translation)^[64][10]
     * Psalm 109:6b "and let Satan stand at his right hand" (KJV)^[65][11]
       or "let an accuser stand at his right hand." ([66]ESV, etc.)

   The other eight instances of satan without the definite article are
   traditionally translated (in [67]Greek, [68]Latin and English) as "an
   adversary," etc., and taken to be humans or obedient angels:
     * [69]Numbers 22:22,32 "and the angel of the LORD stood in the way
       for an adversary against him."
     * 32 "behold, I went out to withstand thee,"
     * 1 [70]Samuel 29:4 The Philistines say: "lest he [David] be an
       adversary against us"
     * 2 Samuel 19:22 [71]David says: "[you sons of Zeruaiah] should this
       day be adversaries (plural) unto me?"
     * 1 [72]Kings 5:4 [73]Solomon writes to [74]Hiram: "there is neither
       adversary nor evil occurrent."
     * 1 Kings 11:14 "And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon,
       [75]Hadad the Edomite"^[76][12]
     * 1 Kings 11:23 "And God stirred him up an adversary, [77]Rezon the
       son of Eliadah"
     * 25 "And he [Rezon] was an adversary to Israel all the days of
       Solomon"

Book of Job

   The examination of Job, Satan pours on the plagues of [78]Job, by
   [79]William Blake

   At the beginning of the book, [80]Job is a good person "who revered God
   and turned away from evil" (Job 1:1), and has therefore been rewarded
   by God. When the angels present themselves to God, Satan comes as well.
   God informs Satan about Job's blameless, morally upright character.
   Between Job 1:9–10 and 2:4–5, Satan points out that God has given Job
   everything that a man could want, so of course Job would be loyal to
   God; if all Job has been given, even his health, were to be taken away
   from him, however, his faith would collapse. God therefore gives Satan
   permission to test Job.^[81][13] In the end Job remains faithful and
   righteous, with by implication Satan shamed in his defeat.^[82][14]

Second Temple period

Septuagint

   In the [83]Septuagint the Hebrew ha-Satan in Job and [84]Zechariah is
   translated by the [85]Greek word diabolos (slanderer), the same word in
   the [86]Greek New Testament from which the English word [87]devil is
   derived. Where satan is used of human enemies in the [88]Hebrew Bible,
   such as [89]Hadad the Edomite and [90]Rezon the Syrian, the word is
   left untranslated but transliterated in the Greek as satan, a
   [91]neologism in Greek.^[92][15] In Zechariah 3 this changes the vision
   of the conflict over [93]Joshua the High Priest in the Septuagint into
   a conflict between "[94]Jesus and the devil," identical with the Greek
   text of [95]Matthew.

Dead Sea scrolls and Pseudepigrapha

   In Enochic Judaism, the concept of Satan being an opponent of God and a
   chief evil figure in among demons, seems to have taken root in Jewish
   [96]pseudepigrapha during the [97]Second Temple period,^[98][16]
   particularly in the apocalypses.^[99][17] The [100]Book of Enoch
   contains references to [101]Satariel, thought also to be [102]Sataniel
   and [103]Satan'el (etymology dating back to [104]Babylonian origins).
   The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren [105]Michael,
   [106]Raphael, [107]Uriel and [108]Gabriel, previous to the [109]fall
   from Heaven.

   The [110]Second Book of Enoch, also called the Slavonic Book of Enoch,
   contains references to a [111]Watcher (Grigori) called
   Satanael.^[112][18] It is a [113]pseudepigraphic text of an uncertain
   date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as being the
   prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven^[114][19] and an evil
   spirit who knew the difference between what was "righteous" and
   "sinful".^[115][20] A similar story is found in the book of [116]1
   Enoch; however, in that book, the leader of the Grigori is called
   [117]Semjâzâ.

   In the [118]Book of Wisdom, the devil is represented as the being who
   brought death into the world.^[119][21]

   [120]Mastema, in the [121]Book of Jubilees, induces God to test
   [122]Abraham through the sacrifice of [123]Isaac. He is identical to
   Satan in both name and nature.^[124][22]

Rabbinical Judaism

   In [125]Judaism, Satan is a term used since its earliest biblical
   contexts, to refer to a human opponent.^[126][23] Occasionally, the
   term has been used to suggest evil influence opposing human beings as
   in the [127]Jewish exegesis of the [128]Yetzer hara ("evil inclination"
   Genesis 6:5). [129]Micaiah's "lying spirit" in 1 Kings 22:22 is
   sometimes related. Thus, Satan is personified as a character in three
   different places of the [130]Tenakh, serving as an accuser (Zechariah
   3:1-2), a seducer (1 Chronicles 21:1), or as a heavenly persecutor who
   is "among the sons of God" (Job 2:1). In any case, Satan is always
   subordinate to the power of God, having a role in the divine plan.
   Satan is rarely mentioned in [131]Tannaitic literature, but is found in
   Babylonian [132]aggadah.^[133][17]

   In [134]Medieval Judaism, the Rabbis rejected these Enochic literary
   works into the [135]Biblical canon, making every attempt to root them
   out.^[136][16] Traditionalists and philosophers in medieval Judaism,
   adhered to [137]rational theology, rejecting any belief in rebel or
   fallen angels, and viewing [138]evil as abstract.^[139][24] The
   [140]Yetzer hara ("evil inclination" Genesis 6:5) is a more common
   motif for evil in rabbinical texts. Rabbinical scholarship on the
   [141]Book of Job generally follows the Talmud and Maimonides as
   identifying the "Adversary" in the prologue of Job as a
   metaphor.^[142][25]

   In [143]Hasidic Judaism, the [144]Kabbalah presents Satan as an agent
   of God whose function is to tempt one into [145]sin, then turn around
   and accuse the sinner on high.^[[146]vague] The [147]Chasidic Jews of
   the 18th century associated ha-Satan with Baal Davar.^[148][26]

Dualism and Zoroastrianism

   See also: [149]Angra Mainyu

   Some scholars see contact with religious [150]dualism in [151]Babylon,
   and early [152]Zoroastrianism in particular, as having influenced
   Second Temple period Judaism, and consequently early
   Christianity.^[153][27]^[154][28] Subsequent development of Satan as a
   "deceiver" has parallels with the evil spirit in [155]Zoroastrianism,
   known as [156]the Lie, who directs forces of darkness.^[157][29]

Christianity

   1854
   Main article: [159]Devil in Christianity
   See also: [160]War in Heaven

   In Christianity, terms that are synonymous with "Satan" include:
     * The most common English synonym for "Satan" is "[161]Devil", which
       descends from [162]Middle English devel, from [163]Old English
       dēofol, that in turn represents an early [164]Germanic borrowing of
       [165]Latin diabolus (also the source of "diabolical"). This in turn
       was borrowed from [166]Greek diabolos "[167]slanderer", from
       diaballein "to slander": dia- "across, through" + ballein "to
       hurl".^[168][30] In the [169]New Testament, "Satan" occurs more
       than 30 times in passages alongside Diabolos (Greek for "the
       devil"), referring to the same person or thing as Satan.^[170][31]
     * [171]Beelzebub, meaning "Lord of Flies", is the contemptuous name
       given in the Hebrew Bible and [172]New Testament to a
       [173]Philistine god whose original name has been reconstructed as
       most probably "Ba'al Zabul", meaning "[174]Baal the
       Prince".^[175][32]
     * Satan is traditionally identified as the [176]serpent who tempted
       [177]Eve to eat the [178]forbidden fruit; thus, Satan has often
       been depicted as a serpent. Justin Martyr, who was born around 100
       C.E., was the first to postulate this association. According to
       Kelly, Justin makes this association "casually", without giving an
       explanation for his reasoning. In Chapters 45 and 79 of Dialogue
       with Trypho, Justin identifies Satan and the Serpent, asserting
       that he tempted humankind for "an unspecified sinful reason" and
       was cursed as a result.^[179][33] However, after Justin, the idea
       was promulgated by his student Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, and
       somewhat later by Tertullian.^[180][34]
     * From the fourth Century [181]Lucifer is sometimes used in Christian
       theology to refer to Satan, as a result of identifying the fallen
       "son of the dawn" of [182]Isaiah 14:12 with the "accuser" of other
       passages in the Old Testament.

   Satan as depicted in [183]the Ninth Circle of Hell in [184]Dante
   Alighieri's [185]Inferno, illustrated by [186]Gustave Doré
     * Other terms identified with Satan include "the prince of this
       world" in the [187]Book of John 12:31, 14:30; "the prince of the
       power of the air" also called Meririm, and "the spirit that now
       worketh in the children of disobedience" in the [188]Book of
       Ephesians 2:2; and "the god of this world" in [189]2 Corinthians
       4:4.^[190][35]
     * The [191]Book of Revelation twice refers to "the [192]dragon, that
       ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan" (12:9, 20:2).
       The Book of Revelation also refers to "the deceiver", from which is
       derived the common epithet "the great deceiver".^[193][36]

   In traditional Christian understanding of the holy Hebrew scriptures,
   the [194]Torah, Satan is a synonym for the [195]Devil. For most
   Christians, he is believed to be an [196]angel who rebelled against
   God—and also the one who spoke through the [197]serpent and seduced Eve
   into disobeying God's command. His ultimate goal is to lead people away
   from the love of God—to lead them to fallacies which God opposes. Satan
   is also identified as the accuser of [198]Job, the tempter in the
   [199]Gospels, the secret power of lawlessness in [200]2 Thessalonians
   2:7, and the dragon in the Book of Revelation. Before his insurrection,
   Satan was among the highest of all angels and the "[201]brightest in
   the sky". His pride is considered a reason why he would not bow to God
   as all other angels did, but sought to rule heaven himself. The
   popularly held beliefs that Satan was once an angel who becomes
   prideful and eventually rebels against God, however, are not portrayed
   explicitly in the Bible and are mostly based on inference (e.g.,
   [202]Ezekiel 28 and [203]Isaiah 14:12–17). In mainstream Christianity
   he is called "the ruler of the demons" ([204]Matthew 12:24), "the ruler
   of the world" and "the god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4). The Book of
   Revelation describes how Satan will be cast out of Heaven, down to the
   earth, having "great anger" and waging war against "those who obey
   God's commandments and hold to the testimony of [205]Jesus".
   Ultimately, Satan is thrown into the "[206]lake of fire", not as ruler,
   but as one among many, being tormented day and night forever and
   ever.^[207][37]

   The early Christian church encountered opposition from pagans such as
   [208]Celsus who claimed "it is blasphemy...to say that the greatest
   God...has an adversary who constrains his capacity to do good" and says
   that Christians "impiously divide the kingdom of God, creating a
   rebellion in it, as if there were opposing factions within the divine,
   including one that is hostile to God".^[209][38]

   In other Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the
   [210]Christadelphians) the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as
   referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any "adversary" and
   figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.^[211][39]

Islam

   Main article: [212]Devil (Islam)
   See also: [213]Azazel § Azazel in Islam

   Shaitan (شيطان) is the equivalent of Satan in [214]Islam. While Shaitan
   (شيطان, from the root šṭn شط⁬ن) is an [215]adjective (meaning "astray"
   or "distant," sometimes translated as "devil") that can be applied to
   both [216]man ("al-ins", الإنس) and [217]Jinn, [218]Iblis (Arabic
   pronunciation: [219][ˈibliːs]) is the personal name of the Devil who is
   mentioned in the [220]Qur'anic account of [221]Genesis.^[222][40]
   According to the Qur'an, Iblis (the [223]Arabic name used) disobeyed an
   order from [224]Allah to bow to Adam and as a result was forced out of
   heaven and given respite until the [225]day of judgment from further
   punishment.

   When Allah commanded all of the angels to bow down before Adam (the
   first Human), Iblis, full of [226]hubris and jealousy, refused to obey
   God's command (he could do so because he had [227]free will), seeing
   Adam as being inferior in creation due to his being created from clay
   as compared to him (created of fire).^[228][41]

     It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels
     prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis (Lucifer); He
     refused to be of those who prostrate."

          (Allah) said: "What prevented thee from prostrating when I
          commanded thee?" He said: "I am better than he: Thou didst
          create me from fire, and him from clay.

                Qur'an 7:11–12

   It was after this that the title of "[229]Shaitan" was given, which can
   be roughly translated as "Enemy," "Rebel," "Evil" or "Devil". Shaitan
   then claims that if the punishment for his act of disobedience is to be
   delayed until the Day of Judgment, that he will divert many of Adam's
   own descendants from the straight path during his period of
   respite.^[230][42] God accepts the claims of Iblis and guarantees
   recompense to Iblis and his followers in the form of Hellfire. In order
   to test mankind and jinn alike, Allah allowed Iblis to roam the earth
   to attempt to convert others away from his path.^[231][43] He was sent
   to earth along with [232]Adam and Eve, after eventually luring them
   into eating the fruit from the [233]forbidden tree.^[234][44]

Yazidism

   An alternate name for the main deity in the tentatively
   [235]Indo-European pantheon of the [236]Yazidi, [237]Malek Taus, is
   Shaitan.^[238][45] Rather than Satanic, however, Yazidism is better
   understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic [239]Middle Eastern
   [240]Indo-European religion, and/or a [241]ghulat [242]Sufi movement
   founded by [243]Shaykh Adi. The connection with Satan, originally made
   by Muslim outsiders, attracted the interest of 19th century
   [244]European travelers and esoteric writers.

Bahá'í Faith

   In the [245]Bahá'í Faith, Satan is not regarded as an independent evil
   power as he is in some faiths, but signifies the lower nature of
   humans. [246]`Abdu'l-Bahá explains: "This lower nature in man is
   symbolized as Satan — the evil ego within us, not an evil personality
   outside."^[247][46]^[248][47] All other evil spirits described in
   various faith traditions such as [249]fallen angels, demons and jinns
   are also metaphors for the base character traits a human being may
   acquire and manifest when he turns away from God.^[250][48]

Satanism

   Main article: [251]Satanism

   Satanic groups have various opinions about Satan, ranging from the
   conviction that he exists and ought to be worshipped ([252]theistic
   Satanism), to [253]Anton Szandor LaVey's symbolic interpretation, which
   emphasizes individual will and pleasure-seeking. In [254]Theistic
   Satanism, Satan is considered a positive force and deity who is either
   worshipped or revered.^[255][49] In [256]LaVeyan Satanism, Satan is
   regarded as holding virtuous characteristics.^[257][50]

   Among non-Satanists, much modern Satanic folklore does not originate
   with the beliefs or practices of [258]theistic or [259]LeVeyan
   Satanists, but a mixture of medieval Christian folk beliefs, political
   or sociological conspiracy theories, and contemporary urban
   legends.^[260][51]^[261][52]^[262][53]^[263][54] An example is the
   [264]Satanic ritual abuse scare of the 1980s—beginning with the memoir
   [265]Michelle Remembers—which depicted Satanism as a vast
   [266]conspiracy of elites with a predilection for [267]child abuse and
   [268]human sacrifice.^[269][52]^[270][53] This genre frequently
   describes Satan as physically incarnating in order to receive
   worship.^[271][54]

       "Term used in the Bible with the general connotation of
       "adversary," being applied (1) to an enemy in war (I Kings v. 18
       [A. V. 4]; xi. 14, 23, 25), from which use is developed the concept
       of a traitor in battle (I Sam. xxix. 4); (2) to an accuser before
       the judgment-seat (Ps. cix. 6); and (3) to any opponent (II Sam.
       xix. 23 [A. V. 22]). The word is likewise used to denote an
       antagonist who puts obstacles in the way, as in Num. xxii. 32,
       where the angel of God is described as opposing Balaam in the guise
       of a satan or adversary; so that the concept of Satan as a distinct

       In discussing myths about groups accused of Satanism, "...such
       myths are already pervasive in Western culture, and the development
       of the modern "Satanic Scare" would be impossible to explain
       without showing how these myths helped organize concerns and
       beliefs." Accusations of Satanism are traced from the witch hunts,
       to the Illuminati, to the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic in the 1980s,
       with a distinction made between what modern Satanists believe and
       what is believed about Satanists.

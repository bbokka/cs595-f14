   Chiropractic is the largest alternative healthcare  profession that
   utilizes a natural, conservative, hands-on approach to treat conditions
   associated with the neuromusculoskeletal system, without drugs and/or
   surgery. Chiropractors specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of
   conditions which are due to mechanical dysfunction of the joints,
   particularly those of the spine, and their effects on the nervous
   system. They also work in preventative care for people with long term
   back or neck pains.
   There is a scientific and logical basis for chiropractic without
   denying it is a complex art and science with aspects that are not yet
   fully understood or appreciated. With this understanding, you can see
   how chiropractic fits in with other healthcare specialties to provide
   an integrated approach to treating neuromusculoskeletal conditions.
   We offer a multidisciplinary approach to pain reduction & recovery and
   in a small friendly environment. We specialize in spinal core-stability
   rehabilitation and are trained to correct faulty body movement
   patterns. We are fully equipped at rectifying recent abnormal movement
   and muscle imbalances, including past injuries and recurrent aches &
   pains.
   We provide advanced spinal correction utilizing “state of the art”
   chiropractic techniques. Never in the history of chiropractic have we
   been able to provide the level of help and expertise that now exists.
   These newer correction methods are even safer, more comfortable and
   more effective than ever before.

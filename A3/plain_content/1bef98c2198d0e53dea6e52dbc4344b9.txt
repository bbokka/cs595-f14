Searching for Ithaka

   It doesn't matter if you get to Ithaka but rather what you do along the
   way. It's all about the First Rule of Music: the only mistake is to
   stop. This is a blog for the adventures and misadventures of Alan
   Fraser aka Silas Scarborough, musician, writer, and unrepentant critic
   of social media. The adventure was successful in riding a scooter from
   Greece to Scotland and it's anyone's guess what will happen next. It's
   all on the Map.

[7]Big Damage to Fort Worth in Storm

   The storm I mentioned that stopped my show did more than disrupting the
   event as it knocked a wall down in the Fort Worth Stockyards and that
   place is a huge tourist draw for old time Cowtown.  Big Texas steaks
   and rodeo, yeehaw.  I have not been down there so I don't know the
   extent of the damage but I do know cars were taken out by all the stuff
   that fell.  Looks like quite a mess.
   This is most for Tatiana / Yevette / Daisy / I don't remember any
   others as there is no damage to the Fort Worth Rock House and the
   critters are all fine.

[16]Reverend Sasquatch Goes Downtown in a Remix by Vaavi

   Perhaps you think there is some difficult in remixing the good Reverend
   Silas T Sasquatch since he doesn't sing nor does he play an instrument
   more complex than a marijuana pipe.
   Vaavi did the remix on the SoundCloud and you can talk to him as Ethan
   Kyrgyz in Second Life.  Here is a link to his [17]Marijuana Rabbits Ft
   Reverand Silas.  (He is cool as he asked my permission before releasing
   it and of course I gave it)
   Incredible how the good Reverend gets around, isn't it!

[56]God Did Not Hate the Gig - He Hates iPads

   There was an updated memo from the Lord in which he said I still suck
   but that isn't why he sent the storm.  The problem was that I was using
   an iPad for my back tracks and he hates iPads.
   I asked him why he hates iPads as it's just one more piece of useless
   commercial gimcrackery in a world that has forgotten how to make
   anything anyone really needs.
   God told me he hates iPads because the pious put Bibles on them.  I
   asked him didn't he love the pious, aren't they the very best
   Christians.  He said not when they show their piety by spending a
   thousand dollars on a gadget when they could have stolen a Bible from a
   motel and given the money to sick children.
   I told him I see your point.  He said he has another point as the back
   tracks suck.
   I said, hey, man.  I don't think they suck.
   Then he backed off a little and said, well, I'll give you that much.
   The back tracks don't suck but you suck for using them.
   I can't fault him on that as it's fookin' karaoke.  I fookin' hate
   karaoke.  Even if I do it with a guitar, it's still fookin' karaoke.
   Someone said difficulties at the moment are an 'attention getting
   device' but, perhaps I might advise, a rock gig IS an attention getting
   device so anything else is consequently, well, something else.

[65]Silas Gig So Bad God Sent Electrical Storm to Stop It

   "Necromancer" didn't work as I had no beat or timing.  "Empire" failed
   altogether the first time as the volume levels were impossible.  I
   started it again and still my timing is all over the place and it's
   like I'm racing the track.  I couldn't hear the guitar so well and
   that's part of it but it was still ferociously suckworthy.  I tried
   some softer ones likes "Wind on the Waves" and "On a Grecian Morning"
   and those worked fairly ok.
   But I could see the lightning and hear some seriously booming thunder
   so I excused myself to take a look.  Just a short peek was enough to
   know to unplug the kit as one power surge will wreck your whole musical
   life.
   So I stopped the gig and shut down.
   By the time I had everything all shut down, the lightning stopped and
   so did the thunder.
   You tell me that wasn't God saying You Suck.
   I'm really not flogging myself as whether I'm good or bad really
   doesn't matter that much anymore. The only thing that counts is whether
   I can still do it and this wasn't a promising sign.
   No need to evaluate anything just now as I'm tired and the rack is the
   best discussion of all just now.  I'm not depressed.  It's more like
   well, damn ...

[74]Sex Change Operation for Reverend Silas T Sasquatch

   Since the good Reverend has come out, he has further decided he needs a
   sex-change operation.
   The purpose of the sermon is not to bash transgenders but rather
   preachers collecting money for bullshit things (e.g. million-dollar
   churches to themselves, etc).
   That extends to bullshit charities in general as a disgraceful many
   take in an enormous amount of money but most of it goes to those who
   collect it and there is relatively little sent to the cause the charity
   claims to represent.
   This one can't have a script as I didn't like that in the last one.
   Using a script changes the content and changes the delivery so that
   makes a plastic TV reverend who was fake to start.  That doesn't work.
   I need to get real names of charities and likely you have seen lists of
   the Ten Worst or similar.  Reading numbers has no possible chance of
   being funny but it would be good to use real names as what's so scummy
   as some outfit that pretends to help and really doesn't.
   It needs a twist to step out, tho.
   Charity drones that fly to your house to bug the hell out of you
   Salvation Army drones ringing bells.  No need to bust them, tho.
   They're one of the few good guys.
   Must think about that some more and then try it.
   It's a solid two or three hour process to get a five-minute Sasquatch
   video on YouTube and that's if I don't use many effects in Final Cut.
   This is a very slow machine.  If I get clever, it will punish.  So I
   think about it for a while before doing it.  The result may still be
   crap but it is considered crap.

  [83]Ebola is Not Concerning Me at Present

   Dallas is only about thirty minutes from here so Ebola in the wild is
   not making me feel cuddly like a bunny rabbit.  But you have to do such
   disgusting stuff to catch it, all or most of which involve contact with
   bodily fluids.  It seems the operating process is don't kiss anyone if
   blood leaks from unusual parts of the body (i.e. yours or theirs).
   Ebola does not spread through the air but there are already cranks out
   there screaming, it might, it might.  What if it mutates.
   The fact is that it does not spread through the air.
   It's a tough disease to catch if you are not living in filthy
   conditions (e.g. poor sewage systems, poor funeral customs, etc, etc).
   My concern about the disease isn't that it will rise up and kill us all
   but rather that any people, anywhere on the planet, in the face of such
   overwhelming riches, have to live in such squalor that it contains an
   immediate risk of killing them.

  [92]States Rights Medicine in Texas Doing What It Can for Ebola

   A hospital official said the organization had 'dropped the ball' when
   it released a patient with Ebola into the general public in Dallas, one
   of the biggest cities in the country.  (CNN:  [93]Hospital 'dropped the
   ball' with Ebola patient's travel history, NIH official says)
   'Dropping the ball' is a term from baseball and it means a man will get
   on base and your team will be charged with an error.  Perhaps it's my
   distorted left wing thinking that differentiates this from releasing an
   uncontrolled deadly virus into a large population of vulnerable people.
   Texas is on the forefront of a fake fight against the Fed regarding the
   Affordable Care Act.  It costs the people of the State of Texas a lot
   of money as they have to pay for that which they would have got for
   free.
   Previously that type of mindless Rick Perry conservatism just gave you
   bad economics.  Now it gives you Ebola.  Have a nice day ... y'all.
   Here's the beauty part:  the same patient presented three days later
   and was then admitted ... to the same hospital that screwed things up
   in the first place.
   There was The Peter Principle about rising to your level of
   incompetence in an organization and now there is The Perry Principle
   about rising to your level of incompetence in a country.  Of course he
   will run for President as The Perry Principle mandates anyone that
   deficient in any useful skills would not be able to do anything else.

[102]"The Paradise Song" - Thinking About It

   There are two very strong drives, one to make something exceptionally
   damn good and the other to destroy myself.  They have always been at
   war in my head but now it's a full theatre tank battle and things
   explode all over the place.  This is not self-pity but rather
   mystification as the answer to why is still I don't know.
   Drill Sergeant:  Private, you better seriously work on getting yourself
   unfucked.
   Well, that's the trick, isn't it.  The answer to "The Paradise Song"
   may well be contingent on an answer to the other as this is life-long
   combat.
   Probably it's more likely because I didn't go for the PhD and become
   the Great White Scientist like my ol' Dad.  He was a bona fide Big Deal
   around the world with global lectures tours and TV ...  and look at you
   ... what a worthless piece of shit.
   All I wanted to do was play a guitar and get stoned.  So, yah, I'm a
   worthless piece of shit.
   "[103]The Tiger and the Monkey" is from six or eight months back and
   it's obviously for Cat.  It's part of thinking about "The Paradise
   Song" as to what the hell are you trying to do.  The vocal is the
   pitiful lot you would expect but the [104]Lyrics are pretty.
   The Mystery Lady was suggesting "[105]Waiting for a Train" from
   Cincinnati and that is on YouTube but that one really is cast for its
   Fate in life.  I couldn't see lifting that up and saying, well, now
   it's "The Paradise Song" or, well, I could but I wouldn't be satisfied.
   Both of them have a similar sound and it's not even close to rock nor
   is either with full orchestration.  That gets a little hmmm going.
   Except for the pitiful vocal, I think those ones are fairly ok.  That
   still doesn't make it ok to lift either one up to re-use it but the
   vibe of the tune is ... well? ... what?
   Paradise is lots of Heavenly strings.  Yah, if you want a toothache
   from all the sugar.  Or it's blowout power chords with full distortion
   and lasers as I have absolutely loved doing that.  Here is maximum
   audio sensation, maximum video sensation, and a whole lot of physical
   sensation ... total overwhelm and it Does.Not.Stop.  Paradise is that
   and it doesn't stop?
   Well, is it, private?
   Drill Sergeant:  Private, you better seriously work on getting yourself
   unfucked.
   (Yes, they really do say things like that and all my life I have
   marveled at how they managed to teach those beasts at least that small
   measure of English.)

  [114]"Tatiana's Tofu Tatas"

   In the ongoing development of the reality show, Tatiana's Tofu Tats,
   there was a setback today when the new business sign was delivered and
   it read, Tatiana's Tofu Tatas.
   Donika was pissed and told the guy, this is NOT what I meant.  The
   painter said how should I know.  This is California.  Everyone has tofu
   tatas.
   What they finally worked out is he would 'fix it' by painting over
   'Tatas' and changing it to 'Tats!' but who the hell wants exclamation
   points.  I spent quite a long time ensuring every damn exclamation
   point was removed from "Abandoning Paradise!!!"
   So things proceed slowly but she does her best with these Californians.
     For the really special ones, she gives them certificates for
   discounts on wet suits in the hope they will go out swimming ... and be
   eaten by a shark.  You know those Californians, they wear wet suits and
   then go out swimming around where sharks live.  Then they scream up and
   down, hey, a shark just chewed off my California face ... now I'll have
   to get all that plastic surgery done again.  But, sunshine, what the
   fuck did you think would happen.

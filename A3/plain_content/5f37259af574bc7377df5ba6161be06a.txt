[5]End of a Chapter, Beginning of Another.

   It's been a fun 1.5 years of college, and I must say I've enjoyed it
   thoroughly. Sure, it wasn't easy, since Concord took me outside my
   comfort zone and I had to adapt and find my niche within it. Of course,
   I wasn't alone. I had my friends, family and teachers to help me out,
   people who I could turn to when I needed them. They helped me grow as a
   person by teaching me new things, and indeed I tried many things for
   the first time when I was in Concord such as rock climbing, frisbee,
   guitar, cooking, Dota and a whole lot of other activities, all because
   of the people around me.
   But, all good things must come to an end. Concord was a short and sweet
   chapter (in relation to Lodge etc.), and has come to a close. The next
   chapter will be much longer, possibly better, possibly worse, but
   definitely different. I'll meet new people, learn new things, have new
   experiences and who knows what else! I'm really interested to know what
   the future holds, but at the same time, full of doubts and
   uncertainties, but I suppose that's part and parcel of starting a new
   chapter in life.
   I look forward to life in Cambridge, even though I know it'll be filled
   with stress, hard work and sleepless nights, because in the end, I'm
   sure it'll all be worth it.

[14]Grad Trip

   Ok this post is probably a little(very) late, but as the saying goes:
   better late than never. The trip basically consisted of 2 main parts:
   Penang and Rawa(an island off the coast of Johor). I arrived in Penang
   on the morning of August 1st, and departed from Johor on the morning of
   August 9th. I must say, this trip was completely worth the time it took
   to convince my parents to allow me to go on. Good food, good company,
   good experiences. For slightly more than a week, I was allowed to live
   life without any worries about university, results or A-levels but
   sadly, all good things must come to an end. I sincerely hope that my
   friendship with this group of people is the exception to that rule,
   because I really appreciate them and the things they've done for me.

[23]Kindness

   When was the last time you made a person's day? Our lives are so busy
   and we are so used to putting ourselves first that often, we fail to
   see that others are in need of help. My life has become increasingly
   boring, with nothing to do every day, so I decided to take an interest
   in the lives of others. (That just made me sound like a stalker) I
   decided to give my time to others and help them solve their problems
   and failing that, to just lend a listening ear and speak a few words of
   comfort. Believe me, I haven't felt this good in ages, especially when
   people thank me for my help or say that they feel better. Like I said
   before in a previous post, I'm happy when others are happy. Some may
   criticise my way of thinking, calling it naive and they might tell me
   that the real world is cruel, but that is exactly why we should all
   help each other out. I recall an Enid Blyton story I read when I was
   younger, about a kindness chain where people passed on kindness they
   received to someone else; kindness eventually made it back to the
   person who started the chain. Give it a try, spend some time doing
   something selfless and mark my words, you'll enjoy it and bring a smile
   to someone else as well as yourself.

[32]Results

   Well, results day has come and gone. I expected the results to arrive
   at 3pm, but instead, Concord decided to send them an hour earlier, so I
   was extremely surprised when I checked my phone after my Dota game
   finished and saw everyone talking about results. A quick check of my
   inbox confirmed that results were indeed out, and so, my heart racing,
   I opened the email and downloaded the PDF files of my results.
   The moment I saw my A* for physics, I was instantly relieved. The
   biggest part of my offer: the A*, had been met. I didn't really care
   any more what I got for everything else, my AS UMS were definitely
   sufficient to confirm that I would get the A's that I needed to meet my
   A*AA offer. However, I could not help but feel slightly disappointed
   with my biology result, as I missed out on the A* because of my EMPA. I
   thought the paper was pretty standard, but my marks said otherwise: I
   received a C, 38/60. This meant my A2 modules for biology totalled
   266/300, I missed the A* by 4 UMS. In the heat of the moment, I
   seriously considered sending it for a re-mark, but thankfully, my brain
   was not completely dead and I reminded myself that doing so would serve
   no purpose, as I had already met my offer.
   I have often asked myself the question: "Am I happy?" and on 14th
   August 2014, I could finally answer confidently: "Yes I am".

[41]I Cried Yesterday

   I cried yesterday. For the first time in what seems like an eternity,
   my thoughts were not organised and sharp. Instead, they mixed freely
   together until I could no longer think clearly but instead, saw flashes
   here and there of different memories.There was nothing I could do. I
   was helpless, vulnerable and pathetic.
   I cried because I realised that the future will never be like the past.
   I cried because I realised that some of the most important people to me
   now, will no longer be a part of my life a few years down the road and
   the thought of that honestly scares me.
   There is a saying that humans are not afraid of the dark, we are afraid
   of the unknown. Perhaps that is why I cling to the past and dread the
   future. If my life were a journey, Lodge would be a tiny village; warm
   and cozy. Moving to Concord would be like taking my first steps outside
   the boundaries and walking to a town, albeit a small one, with a faster
   pace of life and exciting sparks of adventure. What lies ahead? I don't
   know. I honestly don't know what to expect. The town and the village
   were safe and comfortable, but now I have to leave them, and venture
   out to the unknown. I don't want to leave. I want to stay here forever,
   but I know that I have to move on and the only way to do that is to
   leave. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why I cried yesterday.

[50]Ignored

   Sometimes, I wish there was another one of me. Just so that there would
   be someone who I could talk to when I most need it, who listens and
   understands, who shares my views and knows how I feel. It's just so
   discouraging when you take the initiative to message someone first and
   you're completely ignored. Guess it's something I need to get used to.
   Before anyone accuses me of being demanding, I'd like to point out that
   you should have the courtesy to at least tell someone straight to their
   face if they're bothering you, simply because it's better for both
   parties that way. You stop getting bothered and the other person gets
   feedback that you don't like talking to them.
   I've had enough of this. I've said it before, I prefer it when people
   are direct. And even when they aren't, they're easy to read. Perhaps
   it's time I find out who actually enjoys and misses my company.

[59]People and Opinions

   I can't help it. This urge to correct people when they are so obviously
   wrong. To point out that what they're saying makes no sense. This
   wouldn't matter if everyone were like me and remained open-minded and
   were willing to change their opinions when proven wrong, but the fact
   remains that people like their opinions, so much that they cling on to
   them and stubbornly refuse to budge.
   I once had this argument with someone where I asked them yes/no
   questions and with their answers, arrived at a perfectly logical
   conclusion which opposed their opinion. Guess what? They chose to stick
   with their opinion instead of admitting they were wrong. Is pride
   really that important? Is it so difficult for us to say that we are
   wrong? I have had my mind changed on many things before, in case you
   were thinking I'm a hypocrite. If people show me evidence and use logic
   to show me that my opinions are flawed, I will thank them graciously
   and revise my opinion.
   Some call this a flaw, I prefer to think of it as my natural instinct
   to eliminate ignorance. People may hate me for this, but so be it.
   After all, if you aren't hated by anyone, you're doing something wrong.
   As always, DM me on twitter/FB message me/Ask.fm me with your thoughts
   (not even sure why I said that, nobody ever follow it anyway)

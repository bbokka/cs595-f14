   1. AMBITION:
   In terms of the filmmakers who create them, some films are challenges;
   some are proofs. In the Challenges, the filmmaker is hoping to discover
   things, hoping to learn things in the process. In a Proof Film, the
   filmmaker is showing the audience what she or he knows. With a
   Challenge, the audience is aligned with the movie, trying to discern
   whether the filmmaker will meet the challenge; whereas with a Proof,
   the audience is dictated to, watching something unfold according to a
   recognizable formula. A Challenge is involving, whereas a Proof is a
   passive experience for the audience. Ambition is to go to places you
   have never gone before with the hope that you will discover something
   positive in the process – a challenge and not a proof.
   There are so many films that have already been made, and made again,
   and then made yet again. Many films of the past had the opportunity to
   get there first – to be the first to portray a particular type of
   character, explore a genre or a style, to tell a story in a particular
   way. The ambitious filmmaker will never be content to walk in others
   ‘first steps. It is not enough to simply provide an update. Repeats are
   just an attempt to provide more products for current tastes, driven by
   profit, not ambition.
   There is always more that can be done — more nuance provided, a
   different perspective offered. With ambition, one asks how a situation
   can be read differently, more fully. Ambition embraces the edict to
   “make strange”, to unlock the oddness in normality. Ambition exposes
   the wonder in the every day, forbids us to take our situation for
   granted.
   Ambitious film goes beyond the engineering that a Proof is. Emotions
   and tensions are easily manipulated by an engineered film. It is a
   challenge to create work that is both surprising and inevitable. With
   an ambitious film, one that is successful, we are pulled through the
   unknown only to recognize – to know again – what we inherently know. An
   ambitious work will make us both know and recognize. An engineered film
   just reconfirms an unquestioned position.
   Ambitious film will do more than just give the audience what it wants.
   To simply provide is all but to pander. Ambitious film takes us into
   new ground where we question our place and ourselves.
   A great film should be more than proof of what the filmmaker knows. Did
   the filmmaker reach higher than themselves and then place himself or
   herself where no planning could guarantee success? This challenge could
   have been a logistical one or one based on editing or scale of the idea
   or anything that makes them work without a net – but a challenge, not a
   proof, a challenge to go where the solution and the result is not yet
   known.
   2. ORIGINALITY:
   So many films that are made feel like remakes of other films already
   out there – and I am not talking about the films that are actually
   intended to be remakes. Some people might find it comforting to
   recognize characters, situations, plots, or behavior, but unless it
   also reveals some new aspect about life, culture, or craft, I find it
   dullDullDULL. There is a pretty high bar established by the great film
   artists that show how it is done. You’d think it would shame others to
   just regurgitate what has already been done, particularly when there is
   such great original work to consider – but so many filmmakers keep on
   traveling down well beaten paths. Some of the over-explored themes and
   techniques can be chalked up to filmmaker ignorance, but that is still
   not a legitimate excuse. Why would one want to repeat what has already
   been done?
   I am always taken by the filmmaker, who in pursuit of originality is
   willing to fail, by the filmmaker who risks elegance or perfection in
   service to taking the audience somewhere new.
   There are many directions in which originality may be manifest, but the
   most common are:
   1) Character: Show us someone we haven’t seen before, whether in
   occupation, attitude, psychology, or behavior; or at the very least,
   show it in a more complete or nuanced or complex manner;
   2) Setting: Show us a part of the world we’ve never been to, a work
   force that is not normally explored;
   3) Narrative Structure or Approach: why tell it linearly? Can we learn
   something more from a different approach? Does it need to have singular
   protagonist?
   4) Aesthetic: Through the camera work, editing style, or design,
   certainly there is a way to make it fresh;
   5) Subject matter: even when choosing to work within a specific genre,
   there is so much that still hasn’t been shown. Is the film fully
   reliant on the dictates of its genre, or is it aiming for new ground?
   Has this story ever been told before?
   6) Inspirations & references: Is the film free of presenting its
   inspirations on its surface (although, alternatively that could also be
   its point)?
   A filmmaker in pursuit of originality seeks to avoid any reliance on
   cliché. Culturally we have developed a shorthand so that we can get to
   a story much quicker or gain access to a complicated emotion.
   3. INNOVATION (VS. ORIGINALITY):
   Innovation, as opposed to originality – which is about content and
   form, is generally about application of technique. Ang Lee’s THE HULK
   was innovative in terms of how it found a multi-screen presentation
   representative of cartoon panels, but the story by the time it made it
   to the screen, certainly wasn’t original. Tom Twyker’s RUN LOLA RUN was
   both innovative and original; its fast forward approach to examining
   secondary characters’ lives was innovative and its approach to a
   thriller genre tale was original.
   Innovation can also extend beyond the experience of watching the film
   itself. The experience of a film is not relegated exclusively to the
   time the audience is in the theater or watching the disc. Filmmakers
   have been making real strides lately extending that experience via
   preceding or other carefully placed shorts. These can be “additional
   value” on a disc, or be found on the Internet and extend the audience’s
   understanding of the film’s universe. Virtual worlds can be created via
   websites and other materials. Even how a film is presented in a theater
   is up for grabs, with various artists providing live scores and other
   forms of expansive entertainment.
   Similarly, many film enthusiasts appreciate innovation on a technical
   level, be it in quality of image, projection, or sound, or in range or
   experience of the same. It is mistake to think that only the well
   financed have access to innovation; the flaunting of one’s limitations
   has often led to innovative work too. In fact the lower budget work can
   afford to take more risks and it is often this experimentation that
   leads the way.
   4. INTEGRITY TO THE CONCEPT:
   Is the movie more important than attracting or “satisfying” the
   audience? Does the filmmaker avoid pandering to popular tastes? Are the
   choices made aligned with the content of the film? Providing pleasure
   does not require compromise of principal, yet this compromise is found
   in many works lacking true ambition.
   There is something counter to ambition in being eager to please. Yet,
   maintaining integrity to the concept does not require abandoning
   satisfying pleasures. An ambitious filmmaker will place the film and
   it’s integrity above the simple pleasures – and this in turn may very
   well deliver a greater pleasure, albeit a more complex one. Integrity
   to the concept is the pursuit of a principal that places greater value
   on the whole than on the sum of its parts. When an individual momentary
   pleasure in the film is in violation to the film’s central concept, it
   breaks the relationship between the audience and the screen. It breaks
   the trust.
   Where is this trust in the concept initially established? It generally
   comes down to what helps us develop expectations. The choice and
   adherence to a genre and its dictates has a great deal to do with it.
   Pacing and composition also helps to establish what we think may happen
   or not. We still can be surprised without sacrificing the film’s
   integrity; we just have to feel simultaneously that that surprise was
   derived from the rules that were established.
   5. DISCIPLINE:
   Discipline might well be a measure of the extent to which a film sticks
   to the rules it has established. Do all the techniques service the
   theme? Are the performance style, cinematography, editing, design, and
   music united behind a common voice, one that was selected via the
   content? Is the narrative told in accordance with the rules of pacing
   that it established, never staying with a shot or scene too long or not
   long enough? Are the aesthetic approaches utilized by the different
   departments working in unison for the intended effect?
   Does all of the content further the story or the themes of the film?
   Unless self-indulgence is part of the concept, have all aspects of such
   self-indulgence been stripped away? Unless digression is part of the
   film’s concept or organizing structure, has the film avoided such
   digression?
   Ultimately, to what degree is all of this done?
   6. TRUTHFULNESS: Truth isn’t just about what is presented, it is also
   about what a filmmaker chooses to not present. To understand a world,
   you need a whole truth. To leave something out distorts, and a
   filmmaker has to take responsibility for that omission. When a film
   makes it look like “evil” is simply an individual choice, and not a
   symptom of something greater, that distortion grows in prominence with
   an audience. On a strictly formal level, that distortion distances an
   audience from the content because we recognize that what looks like a
   complete world is in fact something else.
   A director may make the choice to foreground the performance of his or
   her actor, and not try to demonstrate naturalism. One could argue that
   perhaps this is the greater truth as it acknowledges that all we can
   ever film is someone being filmed, and generally aware of being filmed,
   but regardless it demonstrates the elusive quality of truth on film.
   Yet truth in film is a bit like the court’s definition of pornography:
   we know it when we see it. Or perhaps we know that it isn’t when we see
   something other than truth on film. An overdressed set is something we
   recognize as not being truthful, just like an actor who seeks to convey
   their emotions in too overt a manner, or when an edit is used to hide
   time passage or display it with too heavy a hand.
   7. JOY OF DOING:
   Some films you can look at it and feel the pleasure the team took in
   making it – or rather think you feel that pleasure, because it may very
   well have been anything but fun getting that movie done (writing a bit
   from experience here).
   Filmmaking is an investment of a great deal of time, labor, and money –
   and everyone knows this. Hopefully it is also an investment of a great
   deal of thought, research, and collaboration. Regardless, it is an
   unspoken bargain between the audience and the filmmakers that a film
   will produce more pleasures than what it took to make them. There is a
   quality inherent in certain films that acknowledge the privilege of
   making films and the pleasure that comes with getting to exercise that
   privilege. When a filmmaker is able to get this attitude up on the
   screen, it is as if the filmmaker is inviting the audience to a party.
   The early Godard films certainly have this, as do the films and videos
   of Michel Gondry – you know that both artists really like the ideas
   they are putting forth and that enthusiasm is contagious. Part of the
   fun actually comes from not taking the act of movie making so
   seriously. You could feel this in Richard Lester’s work for sure.
   Tarrantino’s films overflow with enthusiasm for every aspect he is
   putting on screen, from the actors to the music; every second feels
   like a kid in a candy shop.
   8. SINGULARITY:
   Does the film feel like it came from a distinct point of view? Does it
   feel like it came during a specific point in time? If someone else had
   directed it, would it have suffered? Although personally speaking I
   find the “A Film By” credit a distortion, I do think the truly talented
   director puts their stamp on every aspect of the production, they
   become the filter through which every decision is made. When the
   director brings the passion for the project, dedicates the time needed
   to consider all decisions, has the knowledge of the subject, and a real
   appreciation for the depth of human emotion, one would think that their
   individual stamp would resonate all through out the film, but it takes
   something more: they need to have something to say – and it is not just
   the articulation for the film’s themes. Singularity of a work comes
   from a filmmaker’s ability, courage, and confidence to contribute their
   personality into their work, both consciously and subconsciously.
   9. COMMUNICATION OF THEMES:
   Film is a dialogue with the audience. To work on both an intellectually
   & emotionally engaging level, audiences need a communication of both
   ideas and emotions. Audiences appreciate walking away from a film
   having understood or recognized something about their lives and world
   better than before. A well-done communication of themes leaves
   audiences with a clarity at the film’s conclusion. When done well, an
   audience member can go back and look at how each scene and element
   helped the theme to not only be expressed, but also to evolve and
   impact us.
   In short, do we get it? Beyond plot, what is the film about? Well-done
   communication of themes does not mean that a film has to have a
   message; a theme may just be a subject, like love or the family — but
   when done well, the audience can appreciate each element as part of a
   unified whole. Communication of themes allows the take-away from a film
   to be more than just passage of time or the witness to a story.
   Communication of themes allows the audience to be rewarded for
   surrendering their ninety minutes with a deeper appreciation of an
   idea, an emotion, a time, or a place.
   10. CLARITY OF INTENT: I’ve watched so many films that I felt got made
   mainly because they could get made – a director wants to direct and
   actors want to act. When something gets done simply because they can, I
   am left awash in other people’s cynicism. I want to experience
   something because the creative team had something they felt it was
   urgent to express, that they were passionate to get out and
   communicate. Even still when they hit this level, they don’t always
   succeed in getting whatever it is they have to say across.
   Does the audience walk away from the film feeling they understood what
   the director wanted to say in a full and deep way? To me, this is one
   of the key qualities to a film resonating with audiences and audiences
   not getting pissed off. Audiences rebel when they think a filmmaker
   hasn’t done their homework or taken the tale to its conclusion. If the
   audience struggles through a sequence unsure of where it is leading or
   a with a character whom they are not able to anticipate action or
   sympathize with, audiences appreciate learning why the filmmaker felt
   the audience needed to take this journey.
   A filmmaker does not have to spell it out in its entirety but they also
   shouldn’t leave key elements within the realm of the unknown. An
   audience doesn’t require complete understanding of a character’s
   psychology, but they look for some framework as to why they are being
   shown and experiencing what is presented.
   11. SYNTHESIS OF STYLE & THEMES:
   The alignment of form and content is a form of poetry unto itself. Does
   the technique reinforce the content or vice a versa? Although there is
   no right way to judge whether the two forces are aligned well, an
   audience knows it when it sees it. When there is a true synthesis of
   style with the content and themes, we know that we have seen a film
   well told. The attempt to unify these two different strands is itself a
   pleasure to witness, whether or not the filmmakers have actually
   achieved some form of synthesis.
   12. APPLICATION OF TECHNIQUES:
   Did the filmmaker consider all the tools and methods available to them
   and utilize them well? Did they inspire their team, and did their
   collaborators in turn inspire them? Are they thinking about the frame,
   the light, the way they move the camera, the influence of the design?
   Are such techniques breaking new ground? Do they demonstrate evidence
   that they know how such techniques were utilized in other films? Is the
   application of them aligned with the film’s other aspects?
   13. REALITY OF ACTORS: NON-PERFORMANCE, NON-JUDGEMENT OF CHARACTERS:
   It’s a question of directing, and a question of non-directing, whether
   the actors are inhabiting their character or performing them. If an
   actor desires us to feel a certain way about their character, we don’t
   truly feel, but instead are being asked to judge. A lot of genre-based
   filmmaking seeks us to know a character immediately and thus actors are
   often asked to project and let us know whether the character is good or
   bad, noble or selfish, to be trusted or doubted. It is a whole other
   type of filmmaking when actors simply present the character and allow
   their ways and habits to be felt by an audience. It is an easy route to
   ask an audience to judge from the start; it is a challenge to admit how
   hard it is to ever know someone, even as truths emerge. A filmmaker
   demonstrates a respect for individuals, in all their aberrations, and a
   love for humanity in general, when they require the actors to never
   judge their characters and let their interior to emerge over time and
   in details.
   14. PLEASURE (INCLUDING HUMOR, THRILLS & BEAUTY):
   What is the delight that we get to experience due to what the film
   presents to us?
   Was the film enjoyable? Has the film taken us to a place that we enjoy?
   Was the time taken to watch the film worth the investment of the time?
   Whether they are heady or escapist, we want to have fun of some sort.
   Films are a unique art form and we delight when we witness filmmakers
   exploiting that the uniqueness. Sound and vision. Story telling and the
   passage of time. Passion and pratfalls. All these things that
   filmmakers can exploit, yet there are many films that seem to ignore
   them completely.
   15. A GOOD STORY WELL TOLD:
   Is the audience “in” the movie from beginning to end? Do we drift out
   of the story unintentionally? Do we have to wait until an undo amount
   of time until we are taken into the story? How quickly do we develop
   any expectations? Do we accept the logic of the characters’ actions?
   All of these are questions pertaining to whether a story is well told.
   Equally of importance is whether the story itself is what one might
   call a good story. Are we fascinated but what is portrayed on the
   screen? Does it move us emotionally? Excite us? But what really makes
   for a good story? Is it simply conflict or an intriguing character?
   Exotic locales, romance, adventure, laughs, and tears? It is a harder
   question to answer although people have tried for centuries. We do know
   it when we see it, just as we know as well when we have witnessed it’s
   opposite.
   16. ACCOMPLISHMENT WITHIN THE MEANS:
   Some films are done in by their filmmakers trying to do too much.
   Sometimes the frame or sequences are over packed and the audience has
   too much to process. Sometimes their budget and aesthetic are not
   aligned and we recognize an unintended falseness to the design.
   Sometimes an audience can recognize a story or concept’s potential and
   see the distance from this and the actual execution. When I started out
   in low budget indie filmmaking, I would tell my directors that they
   could have a dog or a baby in a scene but never both of them; you have
   to make sure you can get one uncontrollable element right before you
   can start adding to it.
   As much as some try to do too much, others don’t try to do enough. One
   doesn’t need a budget to capture emotion or beauty. One doesn’t need
   time to come up with a new idea.
   There is poetry unto itself when one witnesses a filmmaker who not only
   recognizes their limitations but turns that into an asset. Science
   fiction is often though of as a genre that cannot be executed without
   ample funds, but PI, THE GIRL FROM MONDAY, PRIMER, and THE STICKY
   FINGERS OF TIME not only got by, but also had fun with their limits. I
   think the combined budgets of these four films are still under $500K!
   17. AWARENESS & APPRECIATION OF THE WORLD: Reality is a nice thing.
   Film can do a remarkable trick sometimes and help us to discuss
   something about our world that we otherwise might find too difficult.
   Film can help us understand a situation that we might otherwise only
   witness superficially. Film represents reality like no other medium and
   as such can show us a fuller picture of places beyond our immediate
   experience. Film dates itself in the process of recording and again can
   not help but call attention to the here and now. A filmmaker concerned
   with things beyond just entertaining, recognizes this unique power of
   the medium, doesn’t give us an escape from reality, but a deeper
   understanding about it. In reacting to a film, sometimes it seems that
   the filmmaker actively sought to deny the world they live in; an
   ambitious work does just the opposite, and we the audience leave such a
   film with a greater awareness of our world.
   18. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE LIMITS OF FEATURE FILM FORM:
   A traditional feature, made to be watched linearly, and presented on a
   screen, will always be limited in what it can show or tell. Audiences
   have been trained to follow the protagonist and follow his or her path.
   Yet, every other character that we see on the screen might have an
   equally compelling tale that the filmmakers have chosen to ignore.
   Similarly our protagonist may experience many dull moments that don’t
   necessarily further the plot and have consciously been left out of the
   narrative. Yet, if the reality of these other, seemingly forgotten
   aspects of the whole picture are not some how acknowledged by
   filmmakers, audiences are aware that they are being manipulated to
   focus on a singular path and not choosing themselves what to witness
   and think about. It is a fine balancing act some filmmakers achieve by
   opening the presentation up to these “asides” in order to give the
   audience a fuller feeling of their free will and thus their chosen
   participation in the events unfolding before their eyes and ears.
   19. CONSIDERATION OF EFFECTS OF REPRESENTATION: To a watch a movie is a
   real choice, even if a lot of the audience might have made it on
   impulse. As a choice, each choice the filmmaker demonstrates carries
   real weight. The choices are as much what is not shown as they are
   about what is shown. A movie that has one gender or race being the bad
   guys is not considering the effects of representation, and frankly
   neither is the film that delivers an unrealistic diversity of cast.
   Making movies is a huge responsibility and there is a definitive
   pleasure in witnessing a team that has embraced that responsibility to
   the fullest.
   20. RECOGNITION OF FILM HISTORY:
   What are a film’s precedents, be it in subject matter or approach? When
   working on a similar terrain as other artists, a filmmaker is extending
   that dialogue. How do they acknowledge they are continuing this
   conversation, and then allow the audience to participate in it too? In
   this day and age of internet downloads and DVD delivery, it is hard to
   imagine that a filmmaker wouldn’t do the research and look to see how
   other people have attempted to solve similar problems or tell similar
   stories. Not everyone may subscribe to the notion that it is our
   responsibility to move the discussion forward, but to ignore the past
   is nothing but lazy.
   21. SUBVERSIVE TO THE STATUS QUO:
   It is too easy to just give the audience more of what they got last
   year. Who has the courage to lead us to somewhere new? How little does
   that actually happen and why is that? We see the world through a fixed
   paradigm and only the visionary can show us a true alternative. Quite
   often, a filmmaker will be diminishing their financial prospects, or at
   least the quick and easy route to them, if they don’t simply serve up
   more of yesterday’s dessert. It not only takes courage and ambition to
   subvert the status quo, but it requires real artistry in order to work
   with current audiences: you just don’t have to do it well, you have to
   do it so well that people both take notice and can engage in a new
   language. Frankly, I imagine that a lot of the best work that is done
   in this area goes unnoticed for some time because both critics,
   curators, and audiences are trained to see anything but today’s filter.
   In America, we have a particularly hard time at looking openly at
   anything that doesn’t reinforce today’s political paradigm other than
   perhaps when it is delivered by the frequently conservative viewpoint
   reinforcer of the dystopian post-apocalyptic aesthetic. Even still,
   it’s easier for American audiences to accept explosive content than it
   is to even consider radical form. We are spoon fed linear narratives
   with dominant protagonists one after the other. When will we be set
   free?
   22. PROVACATION OF THE AUDIENCES: It may not be everyone’s idea of
   pleasure, but film has an uncanny ability to make us squirm in our
   seat. In a “seen it all” culture, the ability to illicit a squirm or a
   hand before the eyes, is a talent that should be rewarded.
   Film can also kidnap an audience and make them complicit in some sort
   of previously unarticulated desire, albeit most often the trinity of
   sex, death, and violence.
   Yet, film’s abilities do not need to be limited to the visual. The deep
   immersion in a world also makes us uniquely susceptible to new ideas
   and ways of thinking.
   Film has the capacity to transform an audience, and an ambitious
   filmmaker hopes to finish the film with an audience that is no longer
   the same as when they entered the theater.
   23. RESPECT FOR THE AUDIENCE: Film is a dialogue between the audience
   and the screen, and like an individual, film can talk down to its
   audience or ignore its audience’s needs. Respect is an equal
   relationship and in film it is reflected by the creative team
   indicating that they don’t think the audience is a bunch of fools or
   unwilling to work for a deeper and richer experience.
   After 100 years of filmmaking, most audiences recognize that a handgun
   introduced in the first act will most likely go after in the third.
   Audiences know that an overt close-up at the end of a shot sequence
   means that the subject is important or will be important in an
   unexpected way. Filmmakers who don’t acknowledge our shared cinematic
   language demonstrate a lack of respect for an audience.
   Since audiences generally have seen many films, to not show them
   something new, make them feel something new, or think of something in a
   new way, demonstrates a disrespect of the audience’s time and
   investment. Movies have to do more than just get made or made with high
   technical standards; they have to aspire to taking us somewhere not
   just new, but something that will provoke us beyond the commonplace
   conclusions of the concept.
   Studios and financiers frequently ask filmmakers “who is the audience?”
   in regards to a project, and they never want to hear “everybody”. They
   expect to have a clearly defined group whom they know how to reach and
   communicate with, but even this demonstrates the beginning of a
   disconnect with the true nature of any community. Nobody likes to be
   defined as a specific demographic. One of the true joys of cinema is
   that it speaks to the expansiveness of the human spirit. Sure we have
   our favorite things, but generally what we initially respond to, are
   just a few of them initially – film can expose a greater part of
   ourselves, and filmmakers willing to do this, show the greatest respect
   for an audience. A movie does not have to be a singular tone. It does
   not have to fit firmly within the dictates of a specific genre. Great
   movies do not require that all the lead characters are people we “love”
   and “sympathize” for. We show audiences respect when we recognize that
   everyone likes to experience new things and recognize them as part of
   themselves.
   24. CONFIDENCE IN THE FILMMAKING:
   Does the movie lead the audience forward and earn our trust? Today’s
   audiences ask the filmmaker to prove it to them that the director is a
   worthy leader; they sit in suspicion waiting for failure until the
   director does something that inspires confidence and erases doubt.
   A filmmaker who is truly confident is also willing to fail; they don’t
   just prove what they know but are also willing to go out on a limb and
   try new things. A confident filmmaker knows that he or she does not
   need to show things in the same way that other filmmakers do; they
   treat the audience to new angles and sequences but are able to do it in
   a manner that does not feel like a show-off or pretentious.
   When a filmmaker has confidence questions of tone and pacing are often
   placed on the wayside as the audience recognizes that these more
   nuanced aspects of filmmaking are fully understood.
   25. RESTRAINT: Some many films feel like a recitation of just the high
   points. These movies live at a peak emotional level and there is no ebb
   and flow to them. The audience is not given any room to breathe. It is
   as if the filmmakers felt the audience had no imagination and that
   everyone is a sensation junky. As much as clarity is something to be
   praised, an ambitious filmmaker leaves room for an audience to make
   their way through a film. Whether it is the pleasure of getting to
   complete a thought on your own and not needing to have it spelled out
   for you, or the delight in the avoidance of the grandiose, holding
   things back can be equally as powerful as displaying other things.
   26. AWARENESS OR AVOIDENCE OF PRETENSION: Film is an art form that
   invites the pretentious to participate. Up until very recently it was
   always conceived of being displayed on the largest of screens in front
   of large numbers of audiences. The scale of it alone gave it a
   pomposity that was hard to avoid. Recognition of this inherent
   phenomenon is the mark of an ambitious filmmaker, regardless of which
   direction they may chose to go in – but to try to hide it or avoid it
   demonstrates a lack of understanding of culture, time, and the medium.
   So many of the Hollywood prestige films try to deny that they think
   themselves important, but whether it is the moody lighting, the over
   wrought performances, or the burnished tones to the sets, we know what
   they want us to feel, even before we hear their score cue us. An
   alternative is to let it all hang out and let the audience know that
   you want to be thought of as Art from the get go. I adored Atom
   Egoyan’s early films for precisely this reason: every aspect of their
   design and presentation cued us that what we were watching was
   important and unique. The current trend of overt “naturalism” in
   independent cinema carries with it a form of pretension delivered by
   the filmmakers’ disavowal of any pretentious devises – its lack thereof
   becomes the very thing it runs from, but at least it is directly on the
   surface and acknowledged by the filmmakers from the start.
   27. ACCESS TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS: As film combines so many diverse
   elements, it has a profound ability to access what lies beneath. We
   experience emotions and sensations in a way we do nowhere else. David
   Lynch is certainly the leader among contemporary filmmakers whom
   attempts to tell a different sort of story. Some filmmakers may chose
   to dwell on the surface or in other levels of meaning, but since the
   attempt to explore the subconscious is on everyone’s palate, it is
   surprising how rare a trait this actually is. You have to wonder why
   with such a powerful tool at their disposal more filmmakers to stake
   out this ground. Yet, when such access is achieved, I am always
   impressed, even when it preys upon that which I wish went undisturbed.
   Bunuel was such a master at this, for even in his straight narrative
   features, he would frequently hit below the depths of our daily
   existence and thus question the order of our world. How many films do
   that nowadays?
   28. DIFFERENTATION AMONG CHARACTERS AND ENVIRONMENTS: Does everyone
   talk in the same voice with the same cadence and vernacular? They don’t
   in my world and they shouldn’t in any filmic world either. Does the
   filmmaker understand or look to exploit this difference, and if not,
   then, why not? Does the uniqueness of each character, set, and location
   say anything about the filmmakers’ outlook on the world in general? If
   a filmmaker hasn’t thought though all of these things, have they truly
   done their job?
   29. LEAVING SOMETHINGS UNEXPLAINED: When did American movies start
   trying to clarify absolutely everything? What is our national obsession
   with trying to provide a psychological explanation for all characters’
   behavior? If you ask me, I think we have gone overboard. Way overboard.
   Time to leave that practice behind.
   It’s refreshing to see a few films recently start to abandon this
   practice. Miyazaki’s PONYO did not try to explain the magic (at least
   in the version released Stateside). Neil Blomkamp’s DISTRICT 9 did not
   try to explain why the aliens landed here or how people learned their
   language.
   It is fun for the viewer to come up with their own explanations, to
   discuss these possibilities with their friends. We certainly don’t know
   everything about our world and leaving some gaps in the narrative feels
   truer as a result.
   David Bordwell touched upon the need for spaces in his great essay “Now
   Leaving From Platform 1” where he explores the hopes of expanding the
   narrative (and yes, okay, I am referenced therein). Our storytellers
   really need to take it to heart. It’s curious that both of these
   examples come from abroad.
   You can even see Bronkamp employing this strategy in the short film
   that launched his feature: “ALIVE IN JOBERG”.
   Neil Blomkamp\’s \”Alive In Joberg\”
   30. EMOTIONAL USE OF TECHNIQUE: There is an emotional quality inherent
   in camera placement and lens choice. There is a similar effect with
   color palate and fabric texture. I don’t think anyone would argue that
   editing style and pacing also qualifies for this honor. As certainly
   does camera movement. Yet, for all of this, I rarely hear filmmakers
   remark about it.
   When we first started working with Ang Lee, I remember that one of
   James Schamus’, my business partner at the time, first observations of
   Ang’s unique talents, was that he had an uncanny understanding of the
   emotional impact of camera placement.
   We need to give our characters space to breathe, to live, to feel. We
   don’t always need to see their faces. We do need to see how they relate
   to their environment. We need to give our audiences time to put
   themselves in the shoes and minds of the characters. We need to use the
   tools we have to do this. I don’t think there is a science to this, but
   more of an instinct, and we know it when a filmmaker does this well, or
   more usually, ignores it altogether. Too many filmmakers allow the
   actors to do all the emoting, and that’s only half the picture.
   31. DEPTH OF CHARACTER / DEPTH OF CHARACTERS
   I don’t like characters to be solely in service to the plot. To
   relegate characters to this secondary position, values actions over the
   people who take them. Audiences will not recognize these characters as
   real people if they feel everyone is there just to drive the story
   forward. Similarly, if all we learn of a character is what is needed to
   advance the plot, our imagination will never be free to roam. Films
   that provide audiences this freedom and openness are generally some of
   my favorites.
   I am regularly impressed by how complex and diverse the people I
   encounter in real life are, but the opposite more than often holds true
   for those I find on the screen. Granted we can’t be expected to capture
   the nuance of any life in 90 minutes, but we can recognize that each
   life encompasses many worthy stories. A consideration of the depth of
   each life in a film is nothing short of respect for life in general.
   The same can be said for the range of characters we meet in a film: is
   everyone just there to service the plot? Here’s to those that have the
   courage to show that life is more than just story and how it plays out!
   Even from the most practical view, filmmakers should want to give their
   characters depth and complexity, if only to engage the audience. A
   feature film is a relatively long-term commitment; audiences are
   interested in more things than just how a body moves from Point A to
   Point B. By enriching the character with fears and hopes, quirks and
   concerns, the desires that both drive or repel, a filmmaker will give
   the audience sufficient substance to hang onto, to actually want to
   anticipate what will happen, to wonder how they will react.
   Frankly, cinema is not just about story.
   32. IMPASSIONED POINT OF VIEW
   Filmmaking should be a scary proposition for anyone who undertakes it.
   To project your feelings, your attitude, your hopes and your horrors up
   on a large screen to a big audience is very brave. Cinema is made to be
   a dialogue with an audience; recruiting an audience is part of the
   process. If it is not screened in front of crowds, I personally think
   it is something other than cinema. But what does it mean to get to
   screen your and your collaborator’s work in front of a crowd?
   When filmmakers are given such a chance, only a few somehow choose to
   actually say something. If people assemble, I think they want to walk
   away with more than an escape from something. The audience wants to
   know what the filmmakers care about – this is one of the pleasures of
   viewing. When film comes with an awareness of the world or a hope for
   something more, it is taking on more and challenging an audience to
   come with it. This quality is there in my favorite films.

[23]My Daughter Is Restricted From Social Media – Maheeda

   [24][mah.png]
   Maheeda in a new chat with Punch:
   I am 31 and I had my daughter when I was 17. I do not think this is
   going to affect her in any way. If my mother did something like this;
   there is no way it would have affected me.
   My daughter is not even aware these nude pictures exist even though she
   has seen pictures of me in bikini. She is not even allowed access to
   the social media. Even if she gets to view them eventually, it’s not
   going to mean anything to her because she has the European mentality.
   When my daughter is 18, then she can decide what she wants.
   Currently, she is under my care and I won’t let her do what I am doing.
   I know what I am doing. The pictures are not targeted at anything. It
   is all about attention and there is no mistake about it.
   This business of music is called showbusiness and I am convinced I am
   on the right track. I owe no apologies.
   I just realised this way will be a faster hit than any other way. The
   pictures are working for me. As you can see, there’s so much attention
   on me.
   All of a sudden, people want to listen to my old singles and are
   looking forward to my debut album.
   In this life, everybody gets criticised whether you do good or bad. I
   have read and heard so much about me that I am now used to it. Thanks
   to them, they have helped me develop a thick skin.
   I am married and my husband is Dutch. What I am doing is not alien to
   him or his family and he understands.
   I met him at a bar when he just came to Nigeria. We are happily
   married. Even before we got married, he understood my kind of person.
   He was aware of my vision. He has always been supportive.
   He just laughs whenever he comes across any of my pictures. It’s in
   Africa that we attach much importance to such things and consider it
   sacrilegious.

[33]Fan Blasts Dammy Krane For Giving Pupils Caprisonne & Biscuit For Charity

   [34][dammy-crane-charity-520x360.jpg]
   Hypertek artiste, Dammy Krane on Friday visited a school and donated
   items like caprisonne, biscuits, sweets and few other things to the
   pupils. After posting the pic, one of his fans felt it wasn’t enough
   that rice and tomatoes would have been more preferable, because
   biscuits are not food.

[57]Nollywood Actress Yetunde Akilapa Beaten, Arrested For Theft In Lagos
Again

   [58][yetunde-akilapa1.jpeg]
   An upcoming Actress, Yewande Akilapa who was recently bailed after
   being imprisoned for theft, has been arrested again.
   Recall that in February, 2013, she was arrested and detained for
   stealing a bunch of master keys in Somolu area of Lagos State.
   She was sent to the Kirikiri prison and after a few months there, she
   regained her freedom, precisely in November, 2013.
   Two days ago, she was caught red-handed with another bunch of master
   keys, beaten by angry residents and arrested again.
   According to Stella Dimokokorkus, she was caught stealing again in
   Magodo Phase 2, No 15, Ibitayo street. While trying to escape, the
   angry residents ran after her, caught her and beat her black and blue.
   Narrating the incident, Stella said “She was escorted back to number 15
   Ibitayo street where she had been caught inside the master bedroom with
   a bunch of master keys hidden in her brassieres.
   Funny enough, the occupants of the house are not friends with the
   Actress and have never met her before or share close friends with her,
   but something strange may be the missing link.
   The occupants of the flat had gone to church, but the sister to the
   head of the family arrived home a little early to attend to her
   business. She put the key into the lock, opened the door, only to find
   Yetunde who was startled and started stammering. She was asked what she
   was doing there and after mumbling some mumbo-jumbo, she exited the
   flat and ran with her legs touching the back of her head… there were
   cries of ”thief” to attract others and after they caught her, she was
   beaten to a pulp, questioned and handed over to the Police after she
   implicated a lot of innocent people in her story. The concerned people
   however arrived the venue to clear their names after agreeing that they
   know her.”

  [68]Ramsey Noah’s Old Lover Resurfaces After 10 years

   [69][Ameze-Imarhiagbe.jpg]
   Ameze Imarhiagbe was one of the hottest and controversial actresses at
   the turn of the millennium and was allegedly in a hot and sizzling
   romance with Nollywood heartthrob Ramsey Noah.
   Just like Regina Askia, the actress left for the US when she was at her
   peak after she was alleged to be pregnant for Ramsey Noah and had gone
   to give birth and never came back until now

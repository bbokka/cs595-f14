[10]Life As A Bridal Minister

   Posted on [11]September 30, 2014 by [12]John Scotus

   Since returning to Japan, I have been involved in many projects to earn
   a living for myself and my family, and as a seminary graduate I
   sometimes work part-time in Japan’s bridal industry.

   The bridal industry in Japan has a bad reputation because most of the
   people getting Christian weddings are unbelievers, as are in fact some
   of the so-called ministers. Indeed, the largest provider of bridal
   ministers in Japan has lately been stipulating in its job ads that the
   only real requirements for a foreign bridal minister are to be able to
   read a prepared script in Japanese and to look good at the front of a
   chapel. No Bible training is necessary, and presumably they do not even
   care if the minister believes in God.

   All of this has led many people (ministers included) to believe that
   the weddings are just a show, and are not taken seriously by anyone.
   However, while I do not necessarily feel all that comfortable doing
   these weddings because in many ways they are a show, and pageantry is
   always given a much higher priority than spirituality, it is truly
   striking to me how most of the couples treat the wedding ceremonies as
   very real, and consequently take them much more seriously than many of
   the ministers or staff members involved.

   This can lead to some interesting experiences.

   For example, the other day the groom was perfectly relaxed before the
   ceremony. However, as soon as the ceremony began, he suffered a nervous
   meltdown. His hands shook so badly that he could barely manage to slip
   the ring on his bride’s finger. As a part of the ring exchange, the
   script went like this:

     Me: Kono yubiwa wa … (Groom repeats)
     Me: watashi no ai no akashi desu. (Groom repeats)

   The English translation is, “This ring … is a testimony of my love.”
   When we practiced this in the rehearsal, the groom had no problem at
   all. However, during the wedding, after I said, “Kono yubiwa wa …“,
   instead of repeating after me, the groom said in a very loud voice for
   all to hear, “watashi no ai no katachi desu!” The translation? “This
   ring … is the shape of my love!”

   Prior to this, the bride was so full of emotion that she was almost
   about to cry. After this, it all went downhill, and if there were any
   tears at all, it was from laughing so hard. And the more everyone
   laughed, the more mistakes the poor groom made. He was very much
   relieved when the ordeal was finally over. Yet, the couple looked very
   happy and all appeared to be forgiven and forgotten by the time they
   left the wedding chapel to ring the wedding bell.

   This was but a minor hiccup compared to what transpired a few days
   later at another wedding, when the bride fainted at the altar.
   Apparently, she was too nervous, too overstressed, too tired, and too
   hot wearing her elaborate wedding gown in the chapel. Fortunately, her
   father was sitting within a few steps of her, and he noticed that she
   was going down. Thinking quickly, he shoved a chair under her before
   she could hit the floor. Crouching nearby was the hotel staff member in
   charge of the wedding. I looked to her and asked quietly what I should
   do. She looked to the groom and the father, and they both motioned that
   we should continue as planned, so I soldiered on with the bride passed
   out in a chair in front of the altar, and the videographer catching
   everything on tape for posterity.

   We came to the vows, and she was now somewhat conscious, but was still
   unable to hold up her head. Her father nudged her, and whispered “Hai!
   Chakaimasu!” (“Yes, I swear!”). She uttered a very feeble “Hai!
   Chikaimasu!” and we continued. Then came the ring exchange. The groom
   slipped her ring on, and then his own. The next part was trickier, as
   they were both supposed to sign their names to the wedding certificate.
   I brought the wedding certificate out and the groom signed it. Then I
   put it in front of the bride. “Sign it!” her father whispered. Somehow,
   without really having her eyes open, she managed to scrawl her name.

   Next, came to pastoral prayer. I had the groom take her by the hand,
   and I prayed over them. I gave the longest prayer I could, praying in
   English that God would give her strength and that she would be able to
   complete the ceremony so that her wedding day would be a blessed and
   joyous occasion for her. I continued praying long after the harpist had
   finished the musical accompaniment.

   I do not know if the prayer itself helped, or just if the length of the
   prayer gave her some much needed time to rest, but when I moved back
   behind the altar, she suddenly sprang to her feet and stood next to the
   groom. I made the wedding pronouncement as quickly as I could, and then
   reminded her in a whisper that there was one more hymn on the program
   before the exit, asking her if she really wanted it. She nodded her
   head “yes”, and so we started the hymn. The hymn was one of those that
   I have only ever heard at a Japanese wedding, and which very few
   people–even Christians–really know the words to, but she sang both
   verses without looking at the wedding program. Then, somehow, she was
   able to stumble out of the wedding chapel to the applause of the
   guests.

   When I was on my way to the dressing room after the service, I saw her
   and the groom sitting alone in the hotel photography studio trying to
   catch their breaths. I went in and asked her how she felt, and she
   explained that she was feeling better by the moment, and that the
   wedding chapel had been too hot.

   She was positively beaming with joy. I have never seen a happier bride.

[33]A “Personal” Email From Mitt Romney

   Posted on [34]September 18, 2014 by [35]John Scotus

   Here is a screenshot of a portion of a “personal” email I just received
   from Mitt Romney:

   [36]Romney email

   This is fascinating on so many levels.

   First of all, how did he get my email address? I work fairly hard to
   keep my email addresses off mailing lists, and have been quite
   successful thus far. Certainly, I have never signed up for anything
   related to Mitt Romney.

   Second, when I click on the links or look at the return address, I see
   that it is not really from Mitt Romney at all. It is from the National
   Republican Congressional Committee. Now, I am all in favor of the
   Republicans gaining control over both chambers of Congress, but anyone
   who knows me or has even spent one second reading my blog would know
   that I have no intention of sending one dime to the Republicans, for
   any purpose–it is part of what is wrong in the US. If something is not
   part of the solution, it is part of the problem, and the GOP is
   definitely part of the problem. People who have money and wish to
   donate it should send it directly to the campaign of the candidates of
   their choice. It certainly should not go to the Republican Party.

   At the same time, Mitt Romney has enough money to fund all of these
   congressional races himself. Yet, when he last ran for president, he
   did not spend one dime of his own money on his own campaign. Given that
   right now I have serious concerns as to how my family will eat next
   week, it is kind of galling to get a letter from a multimillionaire
   begging for money, when he himself is not willing to put his money
   where his mouth is when all is on the line. If he is so worried about
   Obama and his agenda, he should have gone all in back in 2012, and run
   a better campaign.

   So, no. I’m not interested in donating $45 to the Republicans, and find
   it less likely that I would ever donate to them after receiving this
   unsolicited email.

   If they want to win elections, they need to support better candidates,
   and stop sabotaging the candidacies of people who represent new ideas
   and new blood.

[81]Barack Obama Is So Cool

   Posted on [82]September 13, 2014 by [83]John Scotus

   Yes, [84]Barack Obama is so cool. I mean, like, he’s black, you know,
   and I’m so proud that America has a black president, and he’s so cool,
   and we are all so cool for electing him, and everyone is cool just
   because we like Barack Obama and he’s cool.

   And Barack Obama is so cool because he likes children.

   In fact, he’s cool because he was once a child himself.

   And he is cool because he likes the snow.

   And he likes the rain too.

   Oh, my gosh! I can’t believe how cool he is!

   He also likes his wife.

   Now how cool is that! (She’s cool too. In fact, here’s [85]her cool
   page to prove it.)

   And he fist bumps janitors and service people.

   And he’s cool because he likes to dance. (The other guy couldn’t do
   that.)

   And of course he is into all kinds of sports. (I bet the other guy
   couldn’t do that either!)

   He’s so cool, that I can’t imagine why some people don’t support him.
   It must be because he’s cool and black. They are just racist haters.
   That’s all there is to it. True, the world is in flames and America is
   being turned into a run-down trailer park, but it is an unprecedented
   achievement for America to have a black president, who is so cool. And
   we are so cool for having elected him.

   In fact, I feel cool just talking about how cool he is.

   (To be clear, this would be satire if it were not for the fact that
   such a webpage already exists. That any mature adult–whether a
   supporter of Obama or not–would think that any of these things makes a
   person cool, or that any of this matters one whit when it comes to
   policy and the welfare of the American people, is a sign of the dry rot
   that is eating at the American soul.)

[110]The Obamas’ 9/11 Tribute

   Posted on [111]September 13, 2014 by [112]John Scotus

   From the first lady’s Twitter stream:

     The President & FLOTUS joined millions to [113]#Remember911 with
     service by assembling backpacks with [114]@KaBOOM volunteers.
     [115]pic.twitter.com/OpIhhQLIlb

   As in “kaboom”.

   At this point, it is no longer just an issue of optics. The issue is
   that the president and first lady are educated idiots.

[146]“Heard It Through The Grapevine”–Marvin Gaye A Capella Version

   Posted on [147]August 15, 2014 by [148]John Scotus

   Someone was able to isolate the vocal of Marvin Gaye singing “I Hear It
   Through The Grapevine” from the other tracks. They then paired it with
   one of his TV performances.  The result is absolutely bone-chilling.
   This man could sing.

[176]What Can One Dollar Buy Around The World?

   Posted on [177]August 15, 2014 by [178]John Scotus

   What can one dollar buy around the world? (H/t [179]The Blaze)

   In my neighborhood in Japan, one dollar can buy 5 ounces of raw pasta,
   about 2 ounces of raw rice, a bottle of water, 1/4 cup of coffee, or a
   small candy bar.

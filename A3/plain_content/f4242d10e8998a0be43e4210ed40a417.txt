[3]how many likes can this get??

   "How many likes can this get?" I don't care what it is this annoys me.
   One common post in particular really grinds my gears. We've all seen it
   whether on facebook, instagram, twitter, probably tumblr too, idk i'm
   too stupid to figure it out and i don't care enough to learn. It's the
   very annoying comparison of 2 things, saying or implying that one thing
   is beautiful and wonderful, to be loved and cherished while the other
   thing is nasty and to be looked upon with shame and disgust. While
   there's the funny posts comparing curly fries vs cross cut fries, it's
   a common post with women.
   There's variations with it of course but someone is always the beast.
   Fat vs skinny, curves vs 12 year old boy status (yours truly), curly vs
   cross cut, etc
   Here's the image i scrolled across on facebook a few days ago that got
   me started on this:
   [download?mid=2_0_0_1_80178_AEm%2BimIAABrUU5TklAAAAOK2Pu8&amp;pid=2&amp
   ;fid=Inbox&amp;inline=1]
   We're all different and that's the way it was supposed to be. If we all
   looked like Victoria's Secret angels, then what a sad world it would
   be. God made us all different, with different traits and qualities.
   We're all unique and our bodies are a gift to us so why do we shame
   them? I frankly don't give a damn which one of these women is your next
   #wcw because they're both beautiful. I'm not saying they're equal
   because they're sure as hell not, none of us are but they both have
   different qualities. I don't want to say good and bad qualities because
   the status of that is everyone's opinion.
   Don't you find it a little bit twisted that we have to put little miss
   model down to feel little miss boobs feel better about herself? Not
   only with this picture but everyone does it ALL THE TIME!!! Have some
   respect people. I'm not going to lie i do it to. I'm mentally stuck in
   junior high sometimes, so what get off me.
   We've all heard the phrase, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and
   that is so true. Sure i'd love to have the boobs of the girl on the
   left but i also want the stomach of the girl on the right and there is
   someone in the world that thinks that i'm perfect the way i am. Our
   moms are of course one of these people, you may look like a potato but
   your mom thinks you're more beautiful than Jennifer Aniston. To her,
   that is the truest statement in the world.
   To quote my favorite show Girl Code on MTV: "If you feel ugly, you're
   probably not ugly. It's not a real thing. If you feel ugly its probably
   because you're hanging out with the wrong people. You're beautiful
   girl, put on some lip gloss."
   There's not beautiful and ugly, there's just different.

[12]Imma censor your face if you don't can it

   Ignoring my econ teacher today, i was casually scrolling through the
   top news posts on yahoo. Can i talk about yahoo on a google run
   account? anyway i came across not one but two different stories titled
   'Ban Bossy'. Um what...i clicked on both of them and this is just the
   stupidest thing i've seen all day and i'm surrounded by idiots so that
   really is saying something. These were feminist articles discussing how
   through stereotyping and name calling in work places and school
   settings that we diminish women's desire to be leaders. Nobody said
   that they had been called an aggressive leader or a delegater but
   everyone had been called bossy. maybe they're just bitchy and suck at
   running projects? i was irritated by this claim to ban the word bossy
   for a few reasons.
   one of them being that feminists piss me off. everybody wants equality
   but then they want special treatment too? i don't want equality, i like
   being babied and i will admit that. just be nice to me and you won't
   hear me complain. I want to be successful and have achievements yes but
   i still like special attention, i mean i'm a girl i freakin grew up
   knowing i was a princess for pete's sake. still am, don't tell me
   different, i have people that can exterminate you.
   the second reason i'm bugged by this is a pretty obvious one i think.
   ever heard of freedom of speech? ya we live in america people that's a
   thing here. if i want to tell you you're being bossy, you can bet your
   bossy buns i will. it's the same problem with retard and nigger.
   everybody is so darn offended at everything. da boys in the hood call
   eachother nigger all the time and all the wannabe crackers in the hall
   do it too. and does it hurt my feelings? hell. no. do you hear any of
   the retards protesting the word retard? no it's all their uptight moms.
   newsflash ladies, they're just fine the retarded kids at my school are
   my favorite. i was their student aid last year and they're super fun.
   i'm not being mean just because i won't stop using the language that i
   do because you get all butt hurt about it. oh also the word fat. first
   of all nobody is fat. you're not defined by your body. some people just
   have fat to lose..maybe even like 200 pounds of it. i am in love with
   jennifer lawrence like totes wcw material but i disagree with her view
   on this word. she is pushing to get rid of the word fat and that idea
   is completely ridiculous to me. fat is a body tissue. you know what i
   don't like the word muscle, it makes me think of meat heads so buh bye!
   ya see its stupid. and if i wanted to offend somebody by calling them
   fat (which is douchey, don't do it), i  could get a lot more creative
   then just "fat".
   my third reason for hating this 'ban on bossy' is no fear ladies! if
   the reason you're not petitioning for class president or shooting for
   that raise at work or whatever it is because you're afraid of being
   called bossy, i'm afraid you have a lot larger problems than simply
   that. be confident in yourself! you're probably a badass so go out and
   make everybody else believe it too! you can't live your life afraid of
   what everybody else is going to say about you. you're gonna get called
   a slut, attention seeker, bossy, bitch, tool, fat, retard; all those
   offensive words. thrive on them! haters gonna hate, don't be one of
   them. sometimes you have to be your own cheerleader and that's totally
   okay if you ask me (and at least one person thinks i'm always right so
   it's okay if you side with him..i like it)

[21]what just happened..

   i went to a jr high choir concert today...and i cried. i mean i wasn't
   sobbing, there wasn't tears running down my face, but my eyes welled
   up. it was super weird. i was all by myself because my family had other
   arrangements but i went and supported my super cute 11 year old sister.
   now i have only 2 levels to my self esteem: 1) no one loves my awkward
   little self. 2) i am beyonce, bow down chachos!
   today i was closer to #1 when i first showed up all awkward and
   avoiding everyone tapping away on flappy bird. all 2 local friends of
   mine had other things to occupy up their time so i ventured in solo,
   something i NEVER do. it was time for me to add a good sister moment to
   my resume though so in i went. the beginner choir went first and my
   sisters cute dramatic friend was up there, they did awesome and after
   about 4 pieces my sisters choir came on. i don't know what their title
   is..kinda missed it but whatever. anyway i was listening to them and
   was pleasantly surprised. i expected a lot more pitchiness and just
   bitter notes all over the place but they were pretty awesome.
   they sang a song called...well i don't know but something about going
   to Ghana and clapping and it was just great. it was a really fun song
   not only to hear but to watch. you could tell the kids were all really
   into it and no one was stressing about the crowd, they were just having
   fun with their song on the risers. the kids would start giggling and
   smiling at each other through out the song and watching my sister up
   there just got to me for some reason. happy tears welled up and it was
   the weirdest thing. i guess i'm gonna be that mom that's touched by
   everything their child does..oh my heavens i'm sorry planet.
   anyway i'm always pleasantly surprised by her. a year ago she was just
   tomboy that didn't want to spend any time with me cos she thought i was
   prissy. she still thinks i'm prissy but ever since my brother left on
   his lds mission to puerto rico we've kind of been forced to come to
   love each other, the other option is hanging out with our parents..yup
   we decided to be friends. it's been fun. i miss my brother like crazy,
   we were close for most of our time together and i  miss someone to pick
   on me like big brothers do. my sister is adorable though and when i was
   younger i thought  my parents were just saying this to get me to behave
   better but now i see they were right about her looking up to me.
   in the morning when i'm doing my make up she comes up and hugs me and
   asks me what i think about her outfit or her eyeliner and at night she
   just comes in and sits with me and tells me about her day. at first it
   bothered me and i'll admit it still does sometimes, sometimes i just
   want a bubble and everyone to shut up but really i've come to really
   appreciate she wants to spend time with me. i'm really going to miss
   her when i move out in august and even more when my family possibly
   moves further away than 30 minutes. everyone always posts about how
   much they love their siblings and i always understood that when i
   thought about my brother but i never thought i'd actually come to be
   close with my sister 6 years younger than me. she's super cute and i
   just love that girl. she has so much going for her. i hope she reads
   this one day and realizes that she can do anything she wants. she
   really can, when she talks about life she sounds so ambitious and
   excited about it and its beautiful to see. shes so gorgeous and
   talented in anything she tries whether thats music or sports or just
   being nice and yes, kindness is a talent. well anyway i had some
   literally genius to wrap this up with but full house is on so i find my
   mind wandering. i guess i just want to  say appreciate everything, even
   the stuff you think isn't that great cos one day its gonna be super
   special to you like my sister is to me

[30]child of controversy

   i was scrolling through facebook today, as tends to happen on days you
   skip school with a nose full of head drippage, and i came across a post
   about "the R word". that one took me a minute. i don't really take
   offense to much so when someone addresses something so common with such
   a sacred title i don't get it. i have learned what people mean when
   they say "the N word" or "the C word" but i couldn't for the life of me
   figured out what "the R word" was. i clicked on the link and as i
   skimmed through the article i figured it out. Retard!! i didn't know
   that was a cuss word and if you ask me its not and if you think so then
   you're being one.
   now i don't mean to be mean. this mom has a few kids all i think who
   have mental retardation of one form or another so it makes sense that
   she would share this link. i don't have a problem with her i actually
   think she is a very cute lady with fabulous hair. i do however disagree
   with this article. okay confession i didn't actually read it. i got the
   gist of it though. it went on to say that why would we be okay with
   saying retard when we teach that its not okay to say nigger. well first
   of all thats a stupid point cos i dont see a problem with saying
   nigger. oh ya its politically incorrect i forgot. well i flip the bird
   to political correctness it pisses me off. i was listening to a CNA
   lecture the other day for school and she went on blabbing about how the
   only correct way to address a non pure bred american..thats an
   oximoron..is to say "american of _______ decent". what the frak?!
   americans are from all walks of life thats what makes us so cool. in my
   family tree i have spaniards, mexicans, irish folks, all sorts of kick
   butt people. well probably cos they're related to me. oh ya and i'm
   humble. anyway political correctness is stupid. you're from mexico?
   guess what you're mexican. you're black? well i sure as hell ain't
   gonna say african american cos guess what..you're in america so you're
   american..just like me. crazy how that works..faggots
   okay i've gotten lost on a tangent so back to retard. i didn't get past
   the nigger comment and in my head just put together all the articles
   i've read like unto this one and just assumed what the rest of the crap
   was going to be..and i'm probably right lets be  honest. anyway the
   author of this article was all butt hurt and how often we use the word
   retard. that its offensive (to the retards?) and bullying and all that
   crap. which brings me to the topic of bullying but that's a topic for a
   different post.
   i'm not saying running around calling people names is cool cos its not.
   if you need to put someone down so you can feel good about yourself
   from 10 seconds then you need to fix your life. your vocabulary is of
   no importance to me or my life until you're being a tool to someone
   with it, then i start to care. y'all need to stop being so uptight
   about everything. of course i'm gonna call my friends retards, that's
   why we're friends cos they're complete idiots and i dig that. i don't
   go around pointing out people's flaws (out loud at least- i know i'm an
   awful person whatever go plant a tree ya hippie). that's just cruel. we
   all have flaws whether that's an extra chromosome or a big nose or
   whatever. i don't really think an extra chromosome is a flaw though.
   its just an abnormal trait. and as far as i'm concerned those people
   get exalted to the highest degree of glory anyway so why do we feel so
   bad for them they're kickin butt already.
   this post has been a little scattered brained i know but i hope you get
   my point i tried to get across today. don't be such an uptight little
   prick like my aunt. nobody likes those kind of people. your flaws are
   cool, freakin rock them please. and seriously, don't point out the
   flaws of others, trust me they already know they're there they don't
   need you reminding them of insecurities. what it really comes down to
   is be nice and if you don't like what someone else is saying or doing,
   if its not hurting anyone, just have some tea and do some stretching
   cos i promise its okay

[39]what's stopping you

   since it is sunday i figured i'd post something about sunday school
   today. i guess this particular thing was in my young womens class
   today. its march and so we were talking about the atonement of
   christ-the reason he was sacrificed, how we can return home to live
   with our father in heaven if you choose to believe in a higher power.
   one of our many leaders was teaching the lesson and after a little bit
   of introduction she went on to say how no unclean thing can enter into
   the kingdom of heaven so we need to become pure and free of sin before
   we can expect to be able to live with God again. she told us a story
   about how when her and some of her friends' kids were preschool age
   they were all going to share some online thing or something idk..i
   wasn't totally super listening. after chatting about it like preschool
   mommies do, one of them decided that she was going to buy it and copy
   it for all of them to use. one of them made the comment that she wasn't
   about to let such a small sin keep her from living with our heavenly
   father.
   i don't know about any of you chickpeas but id never thought about it
   like that. we tend to follow the way of thinking that since it is such
   a small and insignificant thing we did wrong that it doesn't matter. we
   tend to not view a lot of things as a sin, though they probably are,
   because they are such small every day things we've become calloused to
   them. loitering at work while you're on the clock..opinions? harmless
   right? the truth is you're stealing company time  and even though its
   insignificant time, that time adds up on a daily basis. "though shalt
   not steal" i think i heard that somewhere..
   someone sometime got it in my head somehow that a sin is anything that
   doesn't bring you closer to God. you might argue that sure maybe you're
   not coming closer to God but its not taking you further away from Him.
   except have you seen the teeth whitening commercials that say if you're
   not whitening you're yellowing? same idea. you're always moving in one
   direction or another and its up to you to decide which way that is
   i'm a huge fan of getting new perspective and i just love the  way this
   beautiful lady put it today. We may not have killed anybody today or
   committed adultery and dont get me wrong thats super awesome, thats
   shiny gold star material, but are we really going to let the tiny sins
   keep us from being happy?
   "though shall obey thy father and thy mother". have you heard that one?
   i told you before, i'm 17, naturally this is a toughy for me. i don't
   want to be in on curfew its too early, i don't want to clean my room
   its fine ("it's a mess as is my life, i'm trying to be metaphorical"
   <<this is not a valid excuse i have found). oh ya and dishes are ew!
   (if you don't watch Jimmy Fallon, you're not living) the fact of the
   matter is our parents have been around the block a time or two more
   than us. you may completely disagree with your parents on most things
   and just not see eye to eye on pretty much anything because you're all
   stubbornly set in your ways. but its kind of stupid to think that
   talking back to my mom could be the reason i cant live with my father
   in heaven tho right.
   its a good thought and i'd be willing to bet that if you try to think
   of your decisions in this way from now on, you're gonna make smarter
   choices with better outcomes for yourself..i'm going to do the same and
   lets be honest probably fall short A LOT cos thats just human
   nature..we suck but after we suck enough times, we've kinda been known
   to kick major butt

[48]Disclaimer

   hello internet vagabonds.
   my dad told me I should start a blog and since I like to talk a lot
   about random crap and sometimes be a little bit funny I guess it makes
   some sense. I was actually very flattered. for some reason the words
   "you should write" sound super tender and beautiful to me. I decided
   why not lets be a blogger lady
   I am LDS. for those of you who aren't very familiar with the latter day
   saints we are commonly known as Mormons. no I'm not a sister wife.
   don't get me wrong I'd love to have that many people to share clothes
   with but I don't really want to share my sweetheart, call me crazy(you
   wouldn't be the first). I'm too emotional and jealous for that crap
   anyway so super glad that's not a part of my religion. Mormons are not
   perfect though. especially me. I might swear on occasion and I'm very
   liberal in my opinions so if you're easily offended, maybe some of my
   posts wont sit very well with you but I don't really care too much. in
   my very humble opinion if you're the kind of person that chooses to be
   offended by someone else's lifestyle or opinion just because its
   different than yours then go ahead but I think that's quite foolish.
   don't worry I do it sometimes too
   I'm a senior in high school and have almost 18 years of petty
   inexperiences to talk about so yes, some of my posts will be very "high
   school". however I like to tell myself that sometimes I find a glimmer
   of mature insight in my head so idk, you might be in for a treat.
   the rest I guess will come with my posts as I let you peak in my
   twisted head a titch

[25]Raw Pumpkin Cheesecake (Paleo, Vegan)

   2 October, 2014 By [26]admin [27]Leave a Comment
   [28]raw, paleo, vegan pumpkin faux cheesecake

   I love all things pumpkin, and therefore, I love pumpkin baking season!
   I also happen to LOVE cheesecake, but it doesn’t love me back. Dairy
   gives me zits and makes me gassy (TMI?), which is a common reaction,
   especially if you have a sensitivity to casein. So I set out to invent
   a vegan pumpkin […]

[37]Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bites (Raw, Paleo, Vegan)

   25 September, 2014 By [38]admin [39]Leave a Comment
   [40]cookie dough, paleo cookie dough

   I realized that every time I make cookies, I eat more of the dough than
   the actual cookie. So I decided to combine my love of cookie dough with
   my affinity for healthy little snacks, and voila! These chocolate chip
   cookie dough bites are the result. They take about 5 minutes to whip up
   and […]

   If you’re a dog owner, you’ve no doubt dealt with a bout of doggie
   diarrhea at one point or another. Vets usually recommend a bland
   diet–boiled chicken and rice–but this may not be suitable for or even
   the best remedy for all pets. A quick internet search will probably
   yield you a million confusing suggestions, […]

[54]Fresh Fig Almond Cake (Gluten Free)

   18 September, 2014 By [55]admin [56]Leave a Comment

   Late summer means figs are plentiful. They’re so expensive in the
   markets, so I was thrilled when a friend whose fig tree runneth over
   invited me to her house to go fig picking. I LOVE fresh figs. They’re
   nothing like dried figs, which are available year-round and are much
   easier to get (love dried figs […]

   Every day I get several email requests from people for information
   about how and why I became a certified nutrition consultant. (You can
   read my story here.) Because I get so many of these requests, I did a
   podcast with helpful information for those considering a career change
   or a course of study in nutrition. […]

   Pain. It’s not pleasant, and we’ve all felt it. The most obvious and
   acute causes are injury or trauma, but headaches, joint pain, back
   pain, and chronic pain (defined as a pain that lasts longer than 6
   months) are more insidious. Types of chronic pain include tendonitis,
   carpal tunnel syndrome, and pain affecting specific parts of the […]

[104]Earthing: Pseudoscience or Legitimate Healing Practice?

   1 September, 2014 By [105]admin [106]1 Comment
   [107]earthing, grounding

       I’ve been seeing a lot of claims about the science of “earthing,”
   which is pretty much what it sounds like: walking barefoot to have
   direct contact with the earth. Proponents say that in our urban jungle
   modern city lives, we no longer have direct physical contact with the
   earth and are therefore losing out […]

[109]Homemade Paleo Protein Bar Recipe Round-Up

   [112]Raw-Paleo-Superfood-Bars-post

   One of the most frequent questions I get from clients is, “What can I
   eat for snacks?” Most of them are eating junky protein bars that
   contain whey or soy protein isolates and lots of sugar. Lara bars or
   Kind bars are a better choice but are still high in sugars due to dried
   fruits […]

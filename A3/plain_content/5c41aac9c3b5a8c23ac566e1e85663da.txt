[5]My Preliminary Opinion on How to Write an Area-based Research Article

   On Monday 30^th April, 2012, I was invited as a Technical Editor for An
   Area-based Research Development Journal to be a guest speaker for a
   Work Shop on How to Write an Area-based Research Article for Publishing
   in this Journal.
   One of my missions in this workshop is to encourage and help the
   audiences (researchers & interesting people) to organize and write a
   research article properly substantially and accurately. Since the
   area-based research is a new breed of its kind, just comes into
   existence sometimes around a decade ago. My audiences are really eager
   and wanted me to share my skills & experiences in writing so that
   they’re going to get their research articles published in the Journal
   where in return having their ranks’ promoted etc..
   Ok, the main theme of this is exactly the “How to”, surely this is not
   a difficult thing to talk about but actually the most difficult one in
   term of implementation!
   The first highly important keyword of this is the “SKILL.” and another
   one that often comes along is the “PRACTICE.”
   Skill implies qualifications acquired through regular practice and
   trial until they become innate-like or implicitly yours.
   Before getting into the practical scheme, let’s take a look briefly at
   some area-based research characteristics & factors needed for writing
   the article in my opinion, actually!
   #####
    Some important characteristics of Area-based Research (in my
   opinion):-
   Area-based research or formerly known in the name of Community-based
   research or CBR and what The Thailand Research Fund (TRF) now calls
   Area-based Collaborative research or ABC research. Having several
   differences in some crucial aspects from “Area Studies” initiated by
   the United States after World War II, ABC research has one interesting
   and the most important task different from Area Studies’: that’s for
   the well being and sustainability of community and indigenous people
   while Area Studies is to serve political & governmental stability. Even
   though most of their methodologies are almost the same except the one
   that’s emerged to be the most important for Area-based research
   methodology: Participatory Action Research (PAR), specified the role
   and genuine participation of community as the prerequisite of all its
   research activities; and the using of Knowledge Management (KM)
   technology to extract & exchange knowledge between researchers & people
   in communities and then finally comes up with new knowledge and
   problems solving procedures suitable for use in the community.
   Therefore, in performing area-based research work (in my opinion), a
   researcher has to acquire some special skills somewhat different from
   what have usually belonged to conventional researcher, such as (a)
   ability to observe & keep records all movements and acknowledgement of
   the research population and people in the community amid the
   involvement in research activities according to research design and
   scope; (b) ability to play the roles as a facilitator / catalyst who
   can persuade or encourage people to think, learn and make up their
   minds to solve their own problems; (c) ability to apply technical
   knowledge through KM process; and (d) ability to classify, analyze all
   recorded data and information, most of them are qualitative, and
   synchronize research findings according to specified research
   theoretical framework; to mention a few.
   #####
   Some relevant factors needed for writing area-based research article
   In writing area-based research article for publishing in a research
   journal, the following diagram is a preliminary idea about some
   relevant factors that lead to create a substantial research article,
   digest it and give it a trial:-
   RELEVANT FACTORS NEEDED FOR WRITING AN AREA-BASED RESEARCH ARTICLE:

                                   IN PUT

                         Required Skills & Practice:

   1. Critical Thinking
   2. Complicated Reasoning.
   3. Systematic Thinking
   4. Answering these questions:
   - What is the article about?
   -What difference is the article’s topic & content from others?
   - In what context is this article’s topic: locally, regionally and even
   globally?
   - What are important elements of the article?
   - What are roles & functions of the research findings: technically,
   practically for both communities & local government.
   - What are the likely impacts & trends of the findings?
   -  What should & could be done next?
   5. Keep in mind the journal’s requirement:
   -The journal’s 9-criteria.
   6. Keep in mind basic area-based research methodologies:
   - Community participatory action research.
   - Utility or applicability of the research findings.

                                 Procedure:

   1. Using documentations & complete final report of research results as
   basic references for the article.
   2. Organizing the article’s outline according to the journal’s
   requirement criteria.
   3. Start writing substantially the following issues:
   -Abstract: Within ¾ pages, state briefly the research objectives,
   methodology, data collecting & analyzing techniques, including research
   area and community / local informant participated, and most importantly
   the research results.
   -Introduction: Within 2-2.5 pages, state the significances of research
   topic / question in relation to its social context, environment, and
   community; including the technical aspects and their applicable
   perspectives; the objectives & expected results of this research work.
   -Research methodology: Within ½ page, state what kind of this research,
   where it takes place, who participates in it, including tools used for
   carrying out the tasks like for gathering and analyzing data.

   to research framework & methodology of the findings, including further
   research questions and recommendations.
   4. Review the article thoroughly at least 1-2 times: what should be
   done at this phase are: adding what’s been missing, correcting what’re
   wrongly stated, polishing where the sentences are not concurrent &
   smooth etc.

[18](2) The CBR in Practice

   The How About of… A New Breed of Research Category
   Community-based Research (CBR)
   (2) The CBR in Practice
   CBR by its name implies that activities happen within a specific area
   where people live their lives and /or problems arise, that’s why
   sometimes it’s called – Area-based Research and Development.
   By the way, some hard-core academicians / researchers cast their doubt
   upon CBR; should it be or not be accepted as a research category; some
   accept at most as a case study or the like. Any way, what should be
   done most in this situation is to look closely into the “how it gets
   done” of CBR…
   Apart from the studies released lately by some prominent academicians /
   researchers that indicate interesting assumptions concerning CBR
   practice during the past decade, another way is to dig deeper into
   reality - the way CBR task’s been carried out in the field – the
   followings are some of what we’ll find…
   (1) The Three-Party Collaboration: there are (a) key persons in the
   community, (b) the academicians from faculties / university around the
   area (called later the Facilitator), together with (c) local government
   officials (sometimes this group are community’s stakeholders); these
   three groups work in collaboration with each other in order to come up
   with (a) a set of Rationality which describes the sources of problems
   and relevant technical background knowledge, including (b) a well
   prepared Thesis / Research Statement which clearly indicates the
   objectives of the CBR project, and (c) a research design & methodology.
   (2) Knowledge Management (KM) & Layman as Researcher: there are several
   Special People Conferences where villagers / community members, the
   area’s key figures, the elderly including monks and teachers join in
   activities like brain storming sessions on various topics ranging from…
   how or where the problems happen to... the ways to solve them; this is
   what it’s called KM process. Then community key persons, together with
   a group of professional researchers / academicians or the Facilitator,
   organize & train selected or volunteer members or the Research Team to
   conduct their designated task.
   (3) Data & Information Feed-back: this is one of the Mechanisms
   initiated in the process of analyzing and synthesizing data / info that
   has been collected; and this process might be conducted times & again
   during the course of research work so that the Research Team itself
   would be able to get the “Big Picture” and could find the way out or
   the solution of the work more clearly and easily.
   When the work gets done the problem has been solved the community gets
   a veteran Research Team with more experience and tacit knowledge which
   means that these groups of people have stronger potentiality ready to
   carry out more difficult task in the future by themselves.
   These are some of the CBR practices in reality.
   Key words here are: Facilitator, Key Person, Government Official,
   Stakeholder, Research Team, Special People Conference, Info Feed-back,
   and Big Picture.

[32]The How About of... A New Breed Research Category

   Community-based Research (CBR)
   {This article bases its main ideas on the study on the same subject by
   Dr. Karnjana Keawthep (2009); and Dr. Banchorn Keawsong (2009)}
   (1) How comes the CBR?
   It is said that this New Breed is actually the research for People’s
   Emancipation!
   It unlocks some important prerequisites of the conventional research
   methodologies…
   And it emphasizes the applicability of each research finding…
   Importantly one of its objectives is to transform laymen into Community
   Researchers, who finally would carry on the task to emancipate their
   own community from ignorance & poverty!
   Conventional research as all research literacy already know, by names
   such as Theoretical research, Empirical research, Action research,
   Participatory – Action – Research or PAR etc., and by their procedural
   methodologies known such as… the development of the rationality or/and
   thesis statement… research design, and… data collecting & analyzing
   methods to come up with either qualitative or quantitative findings or
   in both ways.
   However, as most of us also know, a new kind of research emerges or
   being revived all the time, like PAR which has its prominent asset of
   inclusive action into a normal research procedures, together with a lot
   of other kinds of research had just come into existence during mid 20th
   century. CBR itself started during late 20th century and became well
   known in early 21st century and gradually consolidating into a new
   breed in research world since then.
   Community-based Research or CBR has it own Roots, Attributes and
   special Methodology; where it still retains some necessary /
   significant procedures which belong to conventional research, though.
   The Roots: CBR stems from 3 important Roots:
   (1) Technical procedures, eg., using Knowledge Management (KM) in place
   of Literature Review, by means of brain storming on topic concerning
   community problems among key figures in the community, known as –
   Learning Stage & Floor Seminar including Focus Group Discussion or
   Planned meeting.
   (2) People & community Development, eg., using people participation
   process in identifying their own problems and ways or projects for
   solving those problems, known as – Planned Change.
   (3) Layman Approaches, eg., due to its most important objective is to
   transform laymen themselves into community’s researchers, CBR
   methodologies, even though it still accepts and applies some necessary
   conventional research methodologies, those often are in some degrees
   simplified or some are newly created mechanisms; also the expected
   outcomes or research findings are mostly real, down-to-earth applicable
   for solving real problems exist in the community, which are a prove of
   success of this research project.
   In The next “How About…” will deal with the wonderful Attributes of CBR
   and others.
   Until then
   Goodbye for now!

   Writer / Editor: His Holiness Dalai Lama / Renuka Singh
   Publisher: First published in Great Britain in 2004 by Hodder and
   Stroughton Ltd; a division of Hodder Headline PLC
   Content:
   1. The Four Seals in Buddhism
   2. Overcoming Negative Emotions
   3. Self-development through the Six Perfections
   4. Cultivating Equanimity
   5. The Four Noble Truths and the Eight Verses of Thought Transformation
   (The followings are my short notes I took while I read the book; it
   might be useful for anyone who has no time to read the whole book or it
   might tempt you to read the book; anyway, the points I got here might
   not be the same if your read it by yourself…)
   The Fifth Chapter: the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Verse of thought
   Transformation (cont')
   The Eight Verses of Thought Transformation by Langri Tangpa explains
   the Paramitayana practice of method and wisdom: the first seven verses
   deal with method – loving kindness – and the eighth deals with wisdom.
   (1) Determined to accomplish all success, I shall always practice
   holding dear all sentient beings, who are more precious than
   wish-fulfilling gems.
   (2) Wherever I go and whomever I accompany, I shall practice seeing
   myself as the lowest of all and sincerely hold others dear and supreme.
   (3) In all actions, I shall examine my mind, and the moment an
   unsubdued thought arises, endangering myself and others, I shall face
   and avert it.
   (4) Whenever I see a being of wicked nature, who is overwhelmed by
   non-virtue and suffering, I shall hold him dear, as if I have
   discovered a precious treasure, difficult to find.
   (5) When out of jealousy, others treat me badly with abuse, insult and
   the like, I shall practice accepting defeat and offering the victory to
   others.
   (6) When someone I have benefited, and in whom I have great hopes,
   harms me immensely, I shall practice regarding him or her as my holy
   guru.
   (7) In short, both directly and indirectly, I offer every benefit and
   happiness to all my mothers. Secretly, I shall practice taking upon
   myself all their harmful actions and sufferings.
   (8) With all these (practices) undefiled by stains of the superstitions
   of the eight (worldly) dharmas, by perceiving all dharmas as illusory,
   I shall practice, without grasping, to release (all sentient beings)
   from bondage.
   The 8th verse explains that the practices should be done without their
   being stained by the wrong conception of clinging to true existence –
   the superstition of the eight dharmas. How does one avoid staining
   one’s practice in this way? By recognizing all existence as illusory
   and not clinging to true exiatence. Thus one is liberated from the
   bondage of clinging.

   [56][frmwhatiread+(4).jpg]
   The book’s name: The Many Ways to Nirvana
   Writer / Editor: His Holiness Dalai Lama / Renuka Singh
   Publisher: First published in Great Britain in 2004 by Hodder and
   Stroughton Ltd; a division of Hodder Headline PLC
   Content:
   1.     The Four Seals in Buddhism
   2.     Overcoming Negative Emotions

   might tempt you to read the book; anyway, the points I got here might
   not be the same if your read it by yourself…)
   The Fifth Chapter: the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Verse of thought
   Transformation
   5. The Four Noble Truths and the Eight Verse of Thought Transformation.
   Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the cause
   of suffering, the cessation of suffering and the path to the cessation
   of suffering; 3 categories of suffering: the suffering of suffering,
   the suffering of change, and the all-pervasive suffering. The Buddha
   taught that the root of the three sufferings is the all-pervasive
   suffering; generally, the ultimate cause is the mind that is influenced
   by thoughts such as anger, attachment, and jealousy and is the main
   cause of birth and all other problems. The question arises whether or
   not these kinds of negative mind can be eliminated. We can do this by
   investigating how the things it perceives actually exist. Through
   investigation, we find no valid support for the grasping mind but the
   support of logical reasoning for the mind that realizes that the
   grasping mind is invalid. In battle, the mind supported by logic will
   always be victorious over the mind that is not. When we eliminate the
   disturbing negative minds (the cause of all suffering), we eliminate
   the sufferings as well. This is liberation or the cessation of
   suffering (the Third Noble Truth). To achieve this, we must find the
   method. This brings us to the Fourth Noble Truth.
   When we speak of paths, we refer to the 37 factors that bring
   enlightenment. When we speak specifically of the paths of the
   bodhisattavas’ vehicle (Mahayana), we refer to the ten levels and the
   six transcendent perfections. The essence of the practice of the six
   transcendent perfections is the unification of method and wisdom so
   that the two enlightened bodies – rupakaya and dharmakaya – can be
   attained. Since they can be attained only simultaneously, their causes
   too must be cultivated simultaneously. Thus together we must build up a
   store of merit, as the cause of the rupakaya, the body of form, and the
   store of deep awareness or insight as the cause of the dharmakaya, the
   body of wisdom. In the Paramitayana, we practice the method grasped by
   wisdom, and wisdom grasped by method, but in the Vajarayana, we
   practice method and wisdom as one in nature.
   The Eight Verses of Thought Transformation by Langri Tangpa explains
   the Paramitayana practice of method and wisdom: the first seven verses
   deal with method – loving kindness – and the eighth deals with wisdom.

   might tempt you to read the book; anyway, the points I got here might
   not be the same if your read it by yourself…)
   The Fourth Chapter: Cultivating Equanimity
   4. Cultivating Equanimity. Talking about equanimity in the sense of
   alleviating attachment and hatred. Practicing equanimity is the same
   with cultivation of positive qualities like love and compassion: they
   can be based on reasoning and understanding from a particular religious
   basis. An individual practitioner can develop loving kindness and
   compassion by thinking that through such practices, he or she will
   achieve enlightenment because the Buddha taught this path. On the other
   hand, a person could develop such qualities thinking that the
   development of love and compassion would bring mental peace, physical
   well-being, or harmony and peace within his or her family. This kind of
   reasoning is not based on any religious tradition.
   A biased mental attitude or partiality is a big hindrance and an
   obstruction to comprehending reality. For example, the reality is that
   things are dependent on multifarious causes and factors: things are
   interconnected, interdependent and interrelated. When we are unable to
   see this reality, then problems arise because we tend to pick out just
   one factor – whether it is the experience of happiness or that of
   problems and difficulties – and try to use it to explain a complex
   situation. We tend to highlight just one factor out of the many and
   focus exclusively on that particular cause or factor. Because of this,
   we are unable to solve many issues confronting us. In fact instead of
   solving difficulties, we sometimes create additional ones. To deal
   effectively with a particular problem, it is important to prepare
   ourselves mentally to understand the reality of a situation and to be
   able to see facts objectively. You can see why practicing equanimity is
   very important.
   When we confront complex situations and try to solve the problems
   inherent in them, it is important to have a holistic attitude rather
   than a narrow mind. In Buddhist practice, when we talk about developing
   equanimity, we refer to two levels. 1^st – develop a state of mental
   equilibrium, reaching a point where you do not have any special
   attachment to one group and hatred towards another; 2^nd – do not make
   distinctions among other sentient beings; develop a powerful mind,
   wishing to benefit everyone without differentiation.
   By understanding the four Buddhist seals you can reach different stages
   of equanimity. For example, in understanding the 1st teaching that all
   conditional phenomena are impermanent, you realize that all things are
   caused and that they are all transitory and impermanent. The second
   teaching, which says that all contaminated things are suffering means
   that just as my mind is contaminated and polluted and suffering is part
   of my nature, the same applies to all other people. Then I must ask how
   can I hate or get attached to other beings when we are all the same.
   When we talk of Nirvana as peace or liberation as the state of total
   peace, we realize that everyone possesses a Buddha nature and can
   easily develop equanimity.

   Content:
   1.     The Four Seals in Buddhism
   2.     Overcoming Negative Emotions
   3.     Self-development through the Six Perfections
   4.     Cultivating Equanimity
   5.     The Four Noble Truths and the Eight Verses of Thought
   Transformation
   (The followings are my short notes I took while I read the book; it
   might be useful for anyone who has no time to read the whole book or it
   might tempt you to read the book; anyway, the points I got here might
   not be the same if your read it by yourself…)
   The Second Chapter: Overcoming Negative Emotions
   2. Overcoming Negative Emotions. Three levels on which to counteract
   negative emotions: 1^st level – follow the secular ethics and does not
   touch any religious belief; 2^nd level  - in this connection is taught
   by all major religions – they all carry the message of love,
   compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, contentment and discipline; 3^rd
   level – the Buddhist way. Finding for the 4 misconceptions and
   maintaining the four mindfulnesses. The more profound your
   understanding of the selflessness of the person and selflessness of the
   thought, the more you will be able to understand the other side of the
   coin – the inter-connectedness of everything. The first three
   understandings are antidotes that would repudiate their misconceptions.
   By understanding the fourth misconception, we would uproot the seed of
   the misconception of the self. The complete elimination of negative
   emotion is Nirvana. Training the mind is very essential.
   The Buddhist way of practice begins with study by hearing, reading,
   just absorbing information; don’t just rely on Buddha’s quotations.
   Rely instead on your investigations and experiments. In order to
   overcome our negative emotions, we need to use our intelligence to
   analyze, develop positive emotion like strong faith and compassion; in
   this way, wisdom and positive emotions can grow side by side.
   The Third Chapter: Self-development through the Six Perfections
   3. Self-development through the Six Perfections. Buddhist way to
   transform our emotions works not through faith or prayer but through
   the maximum use of intelligence and reasoning. Questions are very
   important. Without questions, we cannot get a proper answer. Without
   skepticism, without doubt, without investigation, we have no
   satisfactory answers. Therefore in the Buddhist tradition, intelligence
   is used to its maximum extent and study is essential.
   Perfections = going beyond; beyond = the place or path of
   enlightenment; the place where we normally exist, in our ordinary form.
   The first two of the Four Noble Truth, that is true suffering and true
   origin of suffering, are on this ordinary side, and the other two
   truths, true path and true cessation, are the paths beyond. Therefore,
   the word “beyond” refers to true types of enlightenment, having gone
   beyond the cycle of existence, the cycle of samsaric existence and,
   therefore, beyond here could refer to the total extinction of
   afflictive emotions and suffering and, thereby, the achievement of
   liberation.
   In order to make your practice one of perfection, you should have the
   clear goal of enlightenment, along with the wish that your
   enlightenment goes beyond liberation just for yourself; you should be
   free from all types of elaborations and achieving the development of
   wisdom-realizing emptiness; 2 types of wisdom-realizing emptiness:
   1.being unable to see emptiness directly but realizing through a kind
   of generic image; 2. perceived or discerned directly and does not
   depend on a medium or generic image; and develop infinite altruism
   through wisdom and intelligence.
   When we talk about the practice of perfections, particularly the
   practice of the six perfections, we discover the practice of the four
   ways of gathering disciplines for maturing one’s mind. Practices like
   concentration and the development of wisdom-realizing emptiness =
   meditations and techniques to improve or enhance one’s wisdom and one’s
   realization. There are two kinds of wisdom: 1. wisdom realizing the
   conventional phenomena; 2. wisdom realizing the ultimate reality,
   ultimate truth.
   Giving = a mental state in which you are always ready to give your
   body, wealth and pleasures when others need them. The practice of
   giving and generosity is meant to enhance one’s wish to give to others.
   Practice of morality = there are 3 types of morality: 1. the morality
   refraining from engaging in negative deeds; 2. the morality collecting
   virtuous qualities; 3. the morality of fulfilling the purposes of
   sentient beings. These 3 kinds of morality are linked.
   Practice of patience = 3 types: 1. patience of being able to bear
   hardships and sufferings; 2. patience of voluntarily welcoming
   sufferings and hardships; 3. patience of developing ascertainment
   toward Dharma practice, which refers to meditating on emptiness.
   We categorize the six perfections into the practice of method and
   wisdom by putting the practices of concentration and wisdom under the
   collection of wisdom; and the practice of giving, the observance of
   morality and a part of the practice of patience under the collection of
   merit. With regard to the practice of effort one part of it is included
   in the accumulation of merit and the other in the accumulation of
   wisdom.
   One should realize that in order to practice Bodhisattvayana, also
   called Mahayana, the foundation of the practice is based on the
   teaching of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. On that
   foundation, the Bodhisattava’s practice is built. In the absence of
   these fundamental practices, the higher level spiritual practices are
   impossible.

[3]Sanu-Key to Success

   No, it’s not a spelling mistake or typo in the title. I
   am emphasizing on the fact that the key to success is Sanu-key: Punjabi
   (Language spoken in the State of Punjab, India) word which loosely
   translates to 'why do I care?'
   I would like to make it clear that in this article, I am not proposing
   total ignorance of humans around you. I am just taking the idea
   introduced in [4]this article in a different way in the context of path
   to success.
   You might be wondering that if I don't care how I can be successful.
   Well, you can be if you don't care about anything, anyone else says,
   but focus only on your goals and ambitions. When on the path to
   success, crossing milestone after another, people do get jealous of you
   - how-so-ever they might be close to you. They may be at the top
   position in your well-wisher's list, but jealousy arises when you shame
   their expectations. In plain-vanilla terms, how can anyone else be
   happy when you are happy because of your own success? No kinship,
   brother/sisterhood, fan club wishes etc. are absolutely true in the
   sense they are portrayed. Only absolute thing in this world is Mother's
   love. Period.
   Other people, they try to discourage you, dwindle your morals and
   confidence, to scare you by telling some of the potential pitfalls you
   might fall into, if you go ahead on your chosen path to success. If you
   even heed to any one of these people, you have, with your own hands,
   erased the picture you created in your childhood where you were
   standing on top of the mountain with your hands stretched wide, facing
   sun and basking in its light. (Might also have Superman's red cape on
   your shoulders)
   Think for yourself, how and why has anyone ever helped you to reach
   where you are today? And if you were unable to pay them back for their
   contribution, have they continued to still behave in the same manner as
   they did some years earlier? I guess NO echoes in your head right now.
   When you helped someone for their progress and they did not acknowledge
   it, have you continued to help them in the same manner? Again the same
   echo, right? Indeed, what goes around comes around.
   So when they don't continue the same relationship with you, why would
   you? Shouldn't you ignore every jabber others do, decide in your mind
   what impression you want to leave of yourself in this world and focus
   only and only on that? This is not the same as to ignore every other
   single soul around you and work for yourself. Rather it is about
   ignoring the shit they have to say and progress on your envisioned path
   and succeed. And maybe then, be the bigger person and help others as
   well to elevate. That leads to a better world where successful,
   talented people help the diametrically opposite ones? As a result, the
   one who always help others, end up being benefited at the end of every
   success story and no one feels as if they were a stepping stone in
   other person's journey to top. Win-win situation, isn't it?
   PS - The idea of this article is not truly original. I read some
   comments online where some quotes similar to the title of this article
   were made. This is just an attempt to expound on the similar lines.
   Hope you like it. Do not forget to share on Facebook, twitter etc.

[14]Rejection is always a choice

   As soon as you read the title, it might or not come to you as to how
   rejection is a choice. It is a consequence of your deeds, isn't it? But
   when I think over it, I feel that it is always a choice for an
   individual. But getting rejected from or rejecting what is another
   question to think over. Let  us take any example out of approaching a
   girl, being in a relationship, choosing a subject to study or a job to
   do, going to visit some place, buying an ice-cream  flavor (or other
   really important things for that matter) and many more.
   I would like to talk about being in a relationship. Relationship does
   not only mean a relation between two lovers. It can be anything between
   two people - love, hate, friends, f-buddies, parent-child, strangers
   etc. Now that a relationship is in place, how does an individual have a
   choice of rejection here? Please note that I am not going to talk about
   acceptance as one has already accepted to be in the said relation.
   The choice of rejection comes when you think of your feelings towards
   the other person. Do you really, actually, from the deepest corner of
   your heart- really feel what you feel about the other person? Or do you
   want your feelings to change to a different, higher or lower level?
   Understand that choice of 'no feelings' is not there, ever, in any kind
   of relationship. Feeling 'no feeling’ is another kind of feeling that
   exists. And that is a choice you have made by 'rejecting' all other
   alternatives of feelings that you could have felt towards the other
   person. (Lots of Fs there)
   That was about rejecting, what about being rejected? It feels bad to
   think of it as if you are going to be rejected by someone else, but
   does this thought cross your mind when you reject other people? How
   they feel when you reject them?
   Here I share an anecdote which, if you think from different people's
   perspective, will illustrate both of these situations. Recently I
   visited an NGO, Kripa foundation, for a workshop course I have to
   complete. Our group met Mr. Bosco there, National Project Head of
   Kripa. During our conversation he asked - What do you say about a
   person, after seeing whose face your whole day is spoiled? (It is just
   your feeling, might not be true) And that person keeps coming back to
   you again and again? (And suppose, it happens again and again) We gave
   various answers which after listening to his answer felt really stupid.
   Why would you even like to have such a person in your life? Wouldn't
   you just ask him to bug off forever? No, you will not after you read
   the next statement. Mr. Bosco's take on this is as follows, “Thinking
   of this from his side, what if after meeting you, his day goes by
   nicely? You are some kind of an angel for that person. Why would you be
   rude to him? No, don't be. Think over it, and the day you understand
   this, your whole life and your relation with people will rise to a
   better level".
   I hope many of you understand what he wanted to say. And I hope you
   also understand this on the lines of what I wanted to say in this
   article.  Stay tuned through Email subscriptions or [15]become a
   follower to receive updates related to Sector S. Cheers :)

[24]Selfish Vs. Selfless

   The following post was written some days back. Hence, I am publishing
   it as soon as I have created this blog space. Hope you like it. Leave
   your responses in the comments below. Thanks.
   People meet, people talk, people hurt, people fight, people cry, people
   criticize, people laugh, people enjoy, they help each other because
   each and every one of them has got something in it for himself or
   herself. It is not for the betterment of the group, but everyone does
   whatever he or she does - just for his own self and, read my
   words, not for anyone else at all. It all boils down to the fact
   that it is your own life my dear friend, you make it or break it, you
   win or lose in it, you earn respect for yourself and you lose your own
   name and no one else's. Then why live just to 'put a smile on that
   face'? Why!? Why all these smiling masks when everyone knows that the
   other person functions in the same way as the said individual do?
   I will tell you why. It is only because it is a social world where a
   guy lives to see smile on a girl's face just because he wants to get
   'something' from this (Read : Her), a parent figure lives to see their
   child prosper so that their child help them in their old age, a brother
   lives so that his brother succeeds and helps him back in future, a
   sister, a friend, a mentor, a student, a colleague, a shop-keeper, a
   vendor and even a stranger live their life just because they have to
   have something in return from the person in front of them. Take it for
   you only. Do you have a single friend whom you meet and talk just for
   the fun and pleasure it gives to you. Never have you asked for any help
   or grace from your friend? Don’t you want something in return for the
   time you spend in your so-called ‘friendship’? If the answer is yes,
   then it is not my defeat, you should realize that either he/she is
   taking benefit of you or it is a short time before you do the same. If
   your answer is no, you second me.

   I don't want to say that one has to be selfish in the present world.
   One also does not have to be completely selfless. But one has to change
   the mixture of these two qualities every now and then to SURVIVE in
   this world. To LIVE, is another thing. Let’s talk about it some other
   time. Cheers :)

[33]Welcome back mshilpesh!

   Hello reader!
   This post is an informal message for you to get a little understanding
   about me as a person and what I have to offer to you in my future posts
   (And a formal welcome for me to the world of blogging).
   It is my great pleasure to be back to the world of blogging after a
   very long time. I started with a blog earlier in 2009 through which I
   used to share my movie reviews and some interesting readings I came
   across on the Internet. With this new blog, that is named the same as
   the previous one (Sector S) (and expects to remain the same till it
   exits), you can expect to read my candid, free-flowing opinions for
   variety of ideas. Or maybe, some random thoughts I just think of when I
   walk on the streets: just anything that I wish to share with you
   people.
   From the time of my last to this new blog space (4 years of my
   engineering), I have grown-up to enjoy the happiness inherent in
   simple, little things life gifts to me every day. I have learnt to
   ignore and say NO (which is an achievement). And the biggest change
   that has happened to me as a person is the realization of the fact that
   studying is not as bad as it seems to be (Blah me).
   Writing (Typing and then publishing: As my current institute's director
   will correctly point out) this first post on this blog puts a big smile
   on my face (Big fan of Joker \m/). I look forward to entertain you with
   my writings as time progresses and also, to make lots of new friends
   through this form of media. Cheers :)

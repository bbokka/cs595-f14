   [42]The Barefoot Walk: Line Up

      Toni Jarvis: Posted on 31 August 2014 16:18

                         The Barefoot Walk: Line up


   Venue: Wollaton Park, Nottingham, NG8 2AE

   Date: Sunday 7 September 2014

   Time: 10am - 6pm

   The Barefoot Walk was the brainchild of Lee Todd who wanted to draw
   people’s attention to the plight of those unfortunate people around the
   world who go barefoot every day – but not by choice. Lee started a
   charity called Shoe-Aid which collects your unwanted shoes and sends
   them to places they are needed.

   So far, Lee has sent over 30,000 pairs of shoes to Africa with the help

   Martinmas Fair

   15 November 2014

   Lenton Priory Church

   Did you like history at school?  I hated the class but loved the
   subject, let's just say I didn't see eye to eye with my History
   teacher! However, the past does hold a great interest.

   Therefore, the geek in me was fascinated to hear that, following
   excavation for the new tram system to Beeston, medieval coins were
   discovered on the site and research has revealed that the Monastery at
   Lenton Priory would have been the site for the original Martinmas Fair.

   [54]The Barefoot Walk

      Jaswinder Basra: Posted on 23 July 2014 17:21







                            Barefoot Blog Travels



   HiEveryone

   What do you normally do on a nice bright Sunday? Relax, garden or even
   watch the Sunday League football?

   How about we change this routine for one day... on the 7th of
   September, by participating in the Barefoot Walk at Wollaton Park.

   The Barefoot Walk is an exciting, exhilarating and exhausting day for
   everyone(especially you). We don't want you just to take a stroll
   around the gorgeous and lush grass of Wollaton Park which feels like a
   mothers hug on your feet (it’s not a competition remember, unless Usain
   Bolt turns up) We want you to jam out to the free music festival and
   take part in all the activities we will have on offer to you!

   [62]We are loving our collaborations!

      Toni Jarvis: Posted on 15 July 2014 10:37


   The sun was finally in our favour for Nottingham StrEAT in July. The
   rain first thing Saturday morning cleared off by the time we were
   setting up to give us a beautiful sunny day, to add to the glorious
   Friday.

   We had a great team of students helping on the stalls, they have been
   with us for a while as part of our Learner Initiative, offering work
   experience to young people, supporting with administration, marketing
   and events.  They manned stalls and engaged with visitors, doing a
   sterling job.

   Through the Tiger Network we often become aware of projects and
   opportunitiesthat we feel are fantastically suited to many of our
   traders and contacts.
   Rutland County Council have kindly informed us of a new project perfect
   for local food-based businesses looking to expand their production
   capabilities as the next step in growing their business.
   To give you some background, HMP Ashwell closed in 2010 and Rutland
   County Council purchased the site from the Ministry of Justice last
   year, and they are now in the process of transforming the 25 acre
   former prison site into a business park with a focus on supporting
   small business and start-ups.

   human grade ingredients for the discerning pooch and owner. They use
   locally sourced ingredients, where possible, with no additives, sugars
   or salts. Their recipes are crafted in such a way that they do not need
   to use preservatives either.

   [90]Taste In The Park - Future Bookings

      Toni Jarvis: Posted on 09 May 2014 16:36


   We had a great event at Newcastle Circus in the Park Estate on 19
   April, with lots of stalls and activities for all the family.  There
   was also a great selection of local talent to entertain us.


   The Park Estate Board reviewed the event at their recent Board
   meeting.  This is their response to our event booking:


   'It was noted that the event itself was not problematic or over
   intrusive and the site was left clean & tidy, which was appreciated.
   The Circuses are offered free of charge on a ‘not for profit’ usage and
   it was felt that such usage ought to be by organisations from within
   the Estate and should be for the benefit of the Estate and its
   residents.

                            For Immediate Release

                      What a difference a Tiger makes!

   Tiger Community Enterprise CIC was set up last June with a simple
   mission: to help enterprises grow.
   A passion for small business and a desire to offer support in
   innovative and collaborative ways has propelled Toni Jarvis, Project
   Director at Tiger, to build connections that, together, have achieved a
   lot in a relatively short space of time.
   The first initiative was Nottingham StrEAT: a street market in the
   heart of the Creative Quarter, bringing together local producers of
   art, crafts, food, drink, street food and social enterprises in a
   showcase platform combined with social media promotion to support the
   participants.

      Toni Jarvis: Posted on 29 March 2014 20:22

      One of the things we get regularly asked is 'Where is the Lace Market
      Square?

      We think it's easy to find, after all it's a stone's throw from the
      Lace Market Tram Stop through Adam's Walk - opposite the Adam's
      Building, but to show you how easy it is we have done some video walks
      to take you there.

      Here's the route from the Old Market Square:

      Toni Jarvis: Posted on 25 March 2014 20:09

   We managed to get video footage of some of our performers at our very
   popular StrEAT at the Galleries event (sorry to those that we didn't
   get, you were great).

   It was a fabulous collaboration, Tiger Community Enterprise joined
   forces with the Galleries of Justice Museum for a family friendly event
   that delighted visitors on Light Night with Terror Tours, streetfood,
   entertainment and surprises in the police cells.

   Here are some of the evening's performances by Tripliquette and
   Marielle Newton and a wonderful 'flavour' of the night filmed by NTU
   Broadcast Journalism students Jessica Armstrong and Megan Baker.

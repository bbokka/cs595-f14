[22]Easy Homemade Tomato Basil Parmesan Soup

   October 3, 2014 By [23]Meal Plan Mom (Brenda) [24]Leave a Comment

   [25]homemade-tomato-soup-with-words

   Ever since I discovered how easy it is to make homemade tomato soup, it
   has become a favorite around our house. We especially like to have this
   soup on Sunday evenings after a busy weekend. It‚Äôs so simple and quick
   to whip up and then we pair it with a grilled cheese sandwich‚Äìsuper
   yum!

   I tweaked a recipe inspired by Jenny Hobick‚Äôs Everyday Occasionas blog
   to create this Easy Homemade Tomato Basil Parmesan Soup and once you
   try it, you may never go back to the premade canned stuff! We actually
   love the soup from LaMadeleine also but at nearly $13.00 for three 15
   oz. jars, making your own can be a lot cheaper too. Plus, you can
   choose to use organic canned tomatoes or even tomatoes from your garden
   you‚Äôve canned yourself. Give it a try and let me know what you think!

   Easy Homemade Tomato Basil Parmesan Soup

   Ingredients
     * 3 cloves of garlic, minced
     * 2 tablespoons olive oil
     * 2 - 14 oz. cans crushed tomatoes, undrained
     * 1 - 14 oz. can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
     * 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
     * 1 tsp salt
     * 1 tsp sugar
     * 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
     * 1/2 cup milk (2% will give you a creamier soup but even a skim is
       ok!)
     * 1 teaspoon dried basil
     * 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

   Instructions
    1. In large saucepan, saute garlic in olive oil on medium heat one
       about minute, until golden but being careful not to burn the
       garlic. Add the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Add broth,
       salt, pepper and sugar. Bring soup to a boil then simmer on medium
       for 10 minutes.
    2. Turn heat to low and stir in milk, basil and parmesan. Top with
       shredded parmesan if desired.

   I‚Äôve had a series of baking snafus in the kitchen over the last couple
   of weeks which is not so great when I‚Äôm hosting the [34]12 Weeks of
   Christmas Treats Challenge. So much for planning ahead! So this week,
   I‚Äôve rounded up a bunch of peppermint-y treats from other bloggers
   around the web to hopefully inspire you to get baking! I love all
   things peppermint, especially when they‚Äôre paired with chocolate. I
   like to keep track of recipes with peppermint on my
   [35]Peppermint-palooza board on Pinterest.

   So here goes! The first four recipes are from me, the rest are from the
   blogs listed. I hope you enjoy this roundup and are inspired to try a

Welcome!

   Welcome to Meal Planning Magic! Here, you‚Äôll find some of the best and
   most up-to-date resources for learning about meal planning and how it
   can help you and your family. Whether your motivation is to save money
   on your grocery bill, eat foods that are healthier or save time in the
   kitchen, you‚Äôve come to the right place. The concepts here are not
   original. There are lots of people out there that have written books or
   developed programs that can help you in the kitchen. But, like so many
   things, I do not believe that there is a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù solution
   to meal planning. You need to find what works for you so it can truly
   work for you! With my own desire to learn more about meal planning, I
   have collected a lot of information and discovered many wonderful
   resources. My effort is your gain when you take some time looking
   around here! So how‚Äôs that for saving even more time? Explore. Learn.
   Have fun!

Salt Grilled Salmon (shiozake)

   [12]Salt Grilled Salmon (Shiozake) | Add A Little

   It’s been quite a crazy start to the week here on Add A Little. How’s
   it been for you?
   Yesterday was pretty cray to the cray to be honest. First of all, I
   make breakfast and the scariest bug was hanging off a calendar (think
   moth crossed with daddy long legs). I have a phobia of bugs so I was a
   bit like ASDFGHJKL OMFSGFSIDFUH. As well as that, I missed my bus THEN
   missed my stop on the way to school and overall it was a pretty hectic
   day!

   How was your start to the week?

   [13]Salt Grilled Salmon (Shiozake) | Add A Little

   On another (slightly more joyful note), I’ve been on a bit of a chicken
   kick this week so had a lil break from it and this is one of the
   easiest and tastiest things to make in my repertoire (ooh fancy I
   know!) and I made a video guys (appreciate ;) )

   I hope you can try it out for yourself : the crispy outer layer that
   encases tender, falling apart salmon! Delicious!

   [15]Salt Grilled Salmon (Shiozake) | Add A Little


   Salt Grilled Salmon (Shiozake) dairy free, gluten free
   Serves 2

   Under 30 minutes for a delicious and healthy weeknight meal to be on
   the table -what more could you want? Salmon is tender and flaky with a
   crispy crust! Serve with a good squeeze of lemon and it’s fantastic the
   next day in a salad.

   2 fillets of salmon
   Sea salt
   Lemon, to serve

   Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

   Salt the salmon liberally and leave on the side for about 10 minutes.

   After about 10 minutes, dab the salmon with a tissue to get rid of any
   excess moisture and add a touch more salt.

   Place skin side down in a hot oven for 15 minutes until cooked through,
   but still tender inside.
   *If you want crispy edges, place salmon ‘meat’ side down, rather than
   the skin, or flip halfway through cooking so it doesn’t stick to the
   foil.

   Serve immediately.

Autumnal Roast Vegetables

   [40]Autumnal Roast Vegetables | Add A Little

   So it’s properly autumn/ fall now! Did you guys know it started on the
   21st? [DEL: I totally didn’t. :DEL]

   I kind of have mixed feelings about this to be honest. Summer’s over
   which means no shorts and going to the beach (unless you want to get
   pneumonia) buuut it does mean more cozy nights in and lots of rom coms.
   So I guess it’s good?

   And, loads of my favourite foods are in season, aka. SQUASH SQUASH
   SQUASH. Have you tried kabocha squash? if you haven’t, you’re seriously
   missing out my friend. For realz, its probably one of my favourite
   foods. It’s got a chesnut flavour and the texture is so fluffy [DEL:
   and my mouth is watering right now :DEL] .

   [41]Autumnal Roast Vegetables | Add A Little

   Also, complete side note: I realised that I’ve never shared my life
   DREAM with you guys (ok, slight exaggeration but ya know).

   I basically really want to go to LA. Oh my gawd, the place of dreams.
   Like for real guys, it has to happen.

   So umm, yeah, just thought I’d let you know that fun fact!

   [42]Autumnal Roast Vegetables | Add A Little

   Autumnal Roast Vegetables vegan, gluten free, dairy free
   Serves 2-3 as a side

   This is a lovely warm side, but I’m sure would be just as delicious the
   next day for leftovers!
   The orange zest lifts the dish and compliments the fennel and carrots,
   as well as the sweet potatoes. It would be delicious with a hint of
   cinnamon to bring out the warmth and goes well with the orange.

   1 large sweet potato
   1 or 2 carrots
   1 bulb of fennel (I only had half on had, but I would have loved more
   of that aniseed flavour!)
   1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
   Salt and pepper, to taste
   1 tsp orange zest
   Bunch of coriander

   Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

   Chop the sweet potatoes into cubes, the carrots into half moons (or
   diagonally) and the fennel into chunks.

   Drizzle olive oil, salt and pepper and massage into vegetables before
   putting them in the oven for 20-25 minutes.

   At the 20 minute mark, check on the vegetables and take out the fennel.
   You may also want to flip the rest of the vegetables.

   Leave in the oven for a further 15-20 minutes, but be sure to keep and
   eye on them!

   Once taken out, grate over the fresh orange zest and season more if
   liked.

Chickpea Wraps {gluten free}

   [67]Chickpea Wraps {gluten free} | Add A Little


   Another back to school lunch for you!! Super easy and won’t weigh you
   down or make you feel lethargic like a traditional wrap – It’s used in
   the same way but has a ton of protein to keep you fuller for longer
   (adios, 3 o’clock slumps!). PLUS, it’s naturally vegan and gluten free!
   Hooray!

   [68]Chickpea Wraps {gluten free} | Add A Little

   To be honest, I only recently discovered chickpea flour, or besan, but
   man it has changed my ball game!
   Lunch has got a whole lot more exciting, PLUS it’s super easy to make
   and they’re customisable!! Add in some blended spinach or beets to make
   coloured wraps, add herbs for flavour, and the filling is changeable to
   suit your needs – I’m sure some kind of sweet filling would work here
   too!

   [70]Chickpea Wraps {gluten free} | Add A Little

   Have you tried using chickpea flour before? If so, what have you made?

   [71]Chickpea Wraps {gluten free} | Add A Little

   Chickpea Wraps vegan, gluten free, dairy free
   Serves 1

   This wrap is a fantastic alternative to store bought tortillas and much
   healthier for you as it is naturally gluten free and super easy to
   make.
   You can make the batter thicker and make them smaller to use them for
   appetisers (eg. smoked salmon and cream cheese) or use as an
   alternative to crepes/wraps.

   1/2 cup gram flour (may be called besan)
   1/3 cup water
   Pinch of salt
   Extra virgin olive oil

   Fillings: hummus, grated carrot, cucumber, tomatoes, butter lettuce,
   coriander, grilled courgette

   Mix the water, gram flour and salt together until no lumps remain.

   Leave in the fridge for about 2 hours.

   Add the olive oil and stir again. Add more water if necessary.

   Cook a thin layer in a non stick pan.
   When the side dries up and starts to lift, flip with a spatula (or your
   hands, or chopsticks as it’s quite delicate if thin).

   Fill with any fillings and enjoy!

   recipe adapted from [72]The Kitchn.

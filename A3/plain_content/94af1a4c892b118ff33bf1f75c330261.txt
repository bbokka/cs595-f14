   I've said this before and i'll say it again - liv gets me through the

   out, she's so understanding - prob because we are literately the same
   exact person.. And i love her to actual death & more

   I wear a lot of makeup too, Mostly because I'm more confident with it.
   Sometimes people point it out or I feel like I need to wear less, but
   if It makes me happy & confident who cares! Ignore the haters
   Thanks bae! I'm pretty confident too, but I just hate the bags under my
   eyes a lot, & lots of my friends laugh at me bc i wear literately so
   much concealer, but it doesn't bother me as much as i made it sound
   like it did... thank you though! :)

   u wear a lot of makeup
   You already asked me that & i didnt answer it bc a, there was a typo,
   and b, i thought it was lame of you to tell me something i'm insecure
   about, which i usually never am, but I hate the bags under my eyes, so
   i "wear a lot of makeup" ... Kinda really uncool, h8ters back off

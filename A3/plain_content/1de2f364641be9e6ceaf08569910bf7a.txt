Soul Searching

   Welcome to my Mind. I'm just a confuse girl that has a lot to say
   sometimes. Writing is how I release all my thoughts and clear my mind.

[3]Lonely Nights

   As darkness looms and the air gets colder
   my heart longs for a shoulder to lean on
   an ear to listen to my 3 am thoughts
   and an arm to hold me when I shiver
   shuffling in my bed tormented anxiety attacks me
   nothing among me but the sound of the crickets outside my door
   loneliness takes over
   not a person in sight to keep me sane
   or to keep me away from the thoughts lingering in my head
   I stare into the darkness of my room expectant
   as if I'm waiting on someone to show up
   someone to tell me I'm not alone
   confused and bored I scroll through my messages
   the bad...the ones I dont want to recall having
   the good...the ones that gives me some hope
   that all my nights won't always be this lonely
   I smile reliving those moments where our conversations go wild
   and my heart flutters to the sound of your voice
   snuggling closer to my pillow I imagine being curled up in your arms
   falling asleep to the sound of your heartbeat and your arms wrapped
   around me.

[12]"Because I said so"

   As kids every why question came with the answer
   "because I said so"
   Why are we doing this "because I said so"
   Why am I doing something that I don't want to do?
   "because I said so"
   and so we grew up not making our own choices
   depending on the decisions of our parents
   "because they said so"
   most of all we were taught to depend on the decisions of our fathers
   you want something go ask daddy
   "daddy why should I do this?"
   "Because I said so"
   and so we have it instilled in our brains that anything a man says go
   We become adults able to make our own decisions
    because we no longer need to answer to our parents
   but then when it comes onto men we do things we don't want to
   you know its a man so "because they said so"
   it is the same thought that has us thinking rape is acceptable
   having sex without the desire to because a man said they wanted it
   it is the same thought that has us thinking that cheating is acceptable
   a man wants to go out and see other women that's okay right because
   they said so
   as long as they're coming home to me even though I don't like the idea
   It is the same thought that forces us to abort a child
   the man wants it done so do it because he said so
   but as women we need to break out of the shackles of our childhood
   we need to stop accepting "because I said so"
   we deserve a full response
   we deserve to make our own decisions
   no "because I said so" is not a good reason for anything
   we need to stand up for something
   or else men will continue to take advantage of us
   we need to change these things from childhood
   parents need to stop telling children "because I said so" and give them
   a full response
   or else they'll regret it in the end
   "because I said so"
   is not a reason its oppression.

[21]Crooked Smile

   There was this petite young lady always nicely dressed a beauty I would
   say
   Always walking with her head towards the ground
   as if she was searching for something below
   from time to time she would look up and down like a bobble-head doll
   mainly because she didn't want to bounce into anyone or anything
   Her face nicely sculpted with neat flared nose
   and lips red like full ripe cherries with a pout so tempting to kiss
   there was something missing from all that beauty she possessed
   .....her smile
   she sat in a crowd of laughing people with a frown on her face
   Why does she hide that smile with a frown?
   Observing that beauty from across a crowded room
   I saw sadness in her eyes
   sadness with a touch of delight
   as if she wanted to smile but her lips were glued together
   Why does she hide that smile with a frown?
   I thought to myself as I stared intently at her from across the room
   She looked quite uncomfortable like she didn't belong
   always shifting or hiding that beautiful face when the camera lights
   flashed
   A face like that why didn't she want her pictures taken?
   Curious to know about this petite beauty I introduced myself
   she looked at me with confusion in her eyes and that frown on her face
   a mumbled reply as if her lips were still glued together
   and a shyness that was both cute and confusing
   I wondered why does she hide that smile with a frown?
   Getting to know her I realized the source of her awkwardness
   Why she covered her mouth when she laughed
   why she walked around with a constant frown on her face
   why she refused to take pictures
   and why she preferred talking to me over the phone than  meeting up in
   person
   behind that frown of her
   was a crooked smile
   ...she never quite saw herself as beautiful because of it
   I spent my days convincing her of how captivating her beauty was
   and still she failed to believe victim to her insecurity
   but all sad stories must end well right?
   eventually she stopped frowning...I made sure of that
   she stopped covering her mouth when laughing which was music to my ears
   her crooked smile flashed right at me melting my heart
   and I fell in love with her....I fell inlove with her crooked smile...

[30]Why do I care?

   Its not always easy to put why you love or care about a person into
   words
   its hard not impossible but its almost like describing the taste of
   water
   there are people who come into our lives by fate
   that leaves footprints in your heart
   and no matter how long you're apart their always there
   inscribed in your heart like a signature
   as if that's where they belong
   and from the moment they enter your life
   they've brought happiness because they never fail to make you
   laugh/smile
   Its like all you've been looking for is within that person
   never fail to tell you the truth no matter how much it hurts
   and you may think what they say is fucked up at first
   but eventually you realized they were right and they only had your best
   interest at heart
   and you care about this person because they care about you
   and because they show how much of a family person they can be
   and the mere fact that your parents respect them
   just draws you to that person
   but sometimes we fail to show how much we care
   Why though?
   I guess there is no feasible excuse
   but no matter how much I fail to contact you
   I will always care
   I care because there is no one i'd rather discuss my darkest secrets to
   than you
   because somehow you keep them close to your heart
   and you dont judge you never judge
   you give advice but you dont judge me
   I care because when I'm around you its like nothing else matters
   I'm free, I'm young I can be myself
   whether crazy, weird, blond, flirty
   I am me when I'm with you
   but yes all these are hard to put into words
   and I hope I've done a good job in describing why I care.

[39]Clitoris

   The clitoris is a beautiful treasure
   hidden behind the labia to feel pleasure
   one simple touch leaves it throbbing
   whimpering slowly her head bobbing
   glistening wet it starts dripping
   she stiffens and starts gripping
   as the shock of pleasure shoots through her body
   her moans resonates like a beautiful melody
   Just one touch of the clitoris
   brings her to her sweat release.

[48]You're like Cancer

   You're like cancer
   slowly creeping through our system
   causing tears and pain
   anger
   suffering
   You're like cancer
   You hurt everyone you touch
   breaking down their defenses
   ruining their lives
   ruining their happiness
   You're like cancer
   damaging people physically
   tearing their hearts a part
   leaving physical pain
   that hurts like hell
   You're like cancer
   You're deadly
   unhealthy for our system
   unhealthy for our minds
   hurting everyone you touch.

[57]She is not enough

   She walks with the false idea
   that she is not enough.
   That among the beautiful diamonds
   she's a plain rock covered in dirt.
   and though they try to convince her
   that her beauty is beyond enchanting
   that it could leave you hypnotized.
   She walks with the thought carved in the back of her mind
   that she is not enough.
   She remembers that one time
   this boy she liked
   described her in such a way
   that she felt she was lacking
   and though he said she was enough
   ...enough for someone else but not him
   she failed to believe it.
   Her thoughts were plagued with questions
   "How can you say I'm enough
   but at the same time say I'm not enough for you?"
   Contradicting statement left her in dismay.
   Still she walked around with the idea
   believing she really wasn't enough.
   that she was a plain rock covered in dirt
   among the beautiful diamonds.

   My Favorite Plate; Chef Jonty Nicolson
   Friday, 27th June 2014
   I suppose my favourite recipe to cook and eat on my menu is our Confit
   Duck Quarter with Olive-Sherry Jus. I like it technically. It is so
   satisfying to make. Done right the confit process ensures consistency
   of that fall-off-the-bone texture to your meat. I love the way the
   salty olive and the sweet sherry compliments the rich generous duck.
   When it comes to food on other peoples menus. I think my favourite dish
   right now is the Hot Tom Yum Soup at Taste of Thai in Hilton.  I love
   it because ... Read more
   My Favorite Plate; Jackie Cameron
   Friday, 20th June 2014
   Jackie Cameron is leaving Hartford House after many wonderful years.
   You can read more on this here. Earlier this year, we asked her for
   some personal favourites - from her own menus and elsewhere. This is
   what she said: "My favourite dish on my own menu changes because I work
   with ingredients that are seasonal and what suppliers bring that looks
   best on any particular day but I think perhaps my Wonderbag cooked Wild
   Boar and Bone Marrow with crispy Esposito Parma Ham, Gourmet Greek

   Jichana is apparently a Swahili slang word meaning âeating wellâ. I
   didnât know that; and to see the restaurant dÃ©cor, branding and menu,
   youâd not expect anything vaguely âSwahiliâ about it. As a matter of
   fact, when we walked in, I guessed the place to be more of a Cuban
   Fusion Jazz joint. Not that there is anything wrong with it, mind you,
   just didnât know where the Swahili eleme...

   There are very few times in life when I find myself giggling with
   delight for any length of time at all. Our visit to the Oyster Box
   Hotelâs Ocean Terrace restaurant had me in stitches of pure joy. This
   was my first visit to the little town of Umhlanga, just North of Durban
   City. A smart little drive from our B&B took us practically side by
   side with the shoreline to the prettiest little town Iâ...

   Daruma
   Daruma authentic Japanese restaurant and Teppanyaki is located on the
   ground floor of the TsogoSun Elangeni Hotel right on the Durban beach
   front. We were looking forward to visiting this restaurant because
   hubby is a bit of a Japanese culture enthusiast. Our Friday evening
   dinner reservation was set for 6pm but I will say that although 6pm is,
   for us, a good time for dinner, it seem...

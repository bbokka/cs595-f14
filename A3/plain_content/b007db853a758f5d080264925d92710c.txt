   Apple has revealed its new smartphones: the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

   The gadgets were announced at a special event in Cupertino, California,
   earlier today by the company’s CEO Tim Cook.

   The devices were revealed at the same location where Steve Jobs gave us
   a first viewing of the Mac three decades ago.

   The iPhone 6 will have a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus will
   be 5.5 inches.

   The screen resolution on the Plus version will be sharper than previous
   iPhones, at 401 pixels per inch rather than 326.

   Apple is taking advantage of the larger screen by offering a horizontal
   view of the home screen. Usually, icons are stacked vertically.

   Apple was also expected to unveil wearable technology.

   Those keen to watch live coverage of the iPhone 6 unveiling won’t be
   able to – unless they’re with Apple.

   Lovers of the tech giant have spent today watching Apple’s website
   count down to the moment it launches its live video stream from the
   event at the Flint Centre in Cupertino, California.

     It's this long until the [20]#iPhone6 event. Follow it here

   But when the time finally came, loyal fans who were using equipment
   other than Apple’s were told that their browser doesn’t support the
   live stream.

   Instead, it advised viewers to switch to Safari 5.1.10 or OS X
   V.10.6.8.
   Cool, thanks Apple (Picture: Apple.com)

[28]Manchester United to rival Arsenal for January signing of Marco Reus

   Marco Reus has been targeted by Arsenal this summer (Picture: AP)

   Arsenal could face competition for the signing of Marco Reus with
   Manchester United reportedly plotting a January move for the German.

   The Gunners have been linked with Reus all summer but a move failed to
   materialise, however reports since Monday’s transfer deadline have
   suggested Arsene Wenger will wait until the end of the season to snap
   up the midfielder.

   But [31]according to the Telegraph, that may prove too late with United
   already considering making a bid for Reus when the transfer window
   reopens in January.

   A £19.8m release clause will come into effect in the Borussia Dortmund
   man’s contract next summer and United hope a bigger offer will convince
   the Bundesliga side to cash in at the turn of the year.

   Louis van Gaal carried out some lavish spending this summer, with the
   likes of Angel Di Maria…

   Mesut Ozil is a doubt to feature in Arsenal’s Premier League clash
   against Manchester City in a week’s time after struggling to recover
   from an ankle injury.

   The 25-year-old suffered the injury towards the end of The Gunners’ 1-1
   draw away to Leicester City at the weekend, which subsequently ruled
   him out of Germany’s 4-2 loss to Argentina on Wednesday.

   According to The Daily Mail, the midfielder flew out late to meet up
   with his international teammates with Germany manager, Joachim Low,
   later confirming that Ozil is ‘doubtful’ to play in the team’s Euro
   2016 qualifier against Scotland on Sunday.

   The extent of Ozil’s injury has not yet been confirmed, but it is
   believed that he may not be fully fit in time for Arsenal’s league game
   against City at the Emirates on 13 September.

[44]Thibaut Courtois reveals he will pen new Chelsea deal after

   Thibaut Courtois will sign a new five-year deal with Chelsea (Picture:

   Thibaut Courtois is set to sign a new five-year deal with Chelsea when
   he returns from international duty.

   The Belgian goalkeeper has kept Blues legend Petr Cech out of the side
   since his return from a three-year loan spell with Atletico Madrid this
   summer.

   And now Courtois’ position as Chelsea’s first-choice stopper is
   expected to be confirmed with a bumper new deal.

   ‘It’s not yet signed,’ Courtois told Sky Sports.

   ‘I am here with the national team so it is difficult, but when I am
   back at Chelsea I will probably sign the new contract.’

   Courtois has helped Jose Mourinho’s side to maximum points from their
   opening three Premier League games this season, as the Blues top the
   table ahead of Swansea, who they face at Stamford Bridge next weekend.

   There really isn’t anything better than a relaxing spa day – and thanks
   to Float Baby Spa in Houston, Texas, tots from as young as two weeks
   old can reap the benefits.

   The Stateside spa provides babies with slightly bizarre looking
   flotation devices, allowing them to bob about a pool as part of a 20
   minute hydrotherapy session.

   Rubber rings worn around their necks allow the wee babes to paddle
   around freely before being treated to a full body massage. Talk about
   lush.

   Liverpool are hours away from the signing of Mario Balotelli after AC
   Milan confirmed they are in negotiations with the Reds over a deal.

   Balotelli has emerged as Liverpool’s number one transfer target as they
   look to add a world class striker to their ranks this summer.

   And after [62]the Italian’s agent arrived in England for talks, [63]Sky
   Italia reporter Gianluca Di Marzio says Liverpool are hoping to close
   the transfer in the coming hours.

   It’s claimed that after having a loan offer turned down, talks are now
   progressing quickly over a permanent deal, [64]with Milan confirming
   contact between the two clubs on their official website.

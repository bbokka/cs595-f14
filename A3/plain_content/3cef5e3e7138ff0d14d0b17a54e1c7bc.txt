[3]BREAKING NEWS: Boko Haram Destroys Bridge Linking Nigeria To Cameroon

   [4]Boko Haram Destroys Bridge Linking Nigeria To Cameroon
   The bombing and destruction of a small bridge linking Nigeria to
   Cameroon in Borno State today has caused mass destruction and
   confusion. The bombing occurred on the outskirts of Gamboru Ngala, site
   of a Monday Boko Haram attack that claimed the lives of over 300
   village residents.
   At least 30 people were killed during the late Thursday afternoon
   bombing incident, sources tell SaharaReporters. The bridge links the
   immigration check points of both Cameroon and Nigeria.
   The bombing event took place on the same day of a mass burial in the
   town of Gamboru Ngala. It was there on Monday where a Boko Haram-led
   raid on the small village claimed the lives of over 300 residents,
   nearly ten per cent of the population.
   Sources told us that 315 people of the 336 who died in the Monday
   attack were buried in a solemn ceremony led by civic and religious
   leaders.
   The Boko Haram has not claimed responsibility for this latest bombing
   attack, but residents of Gamboru Ngala told us that there is deep
   suspicion that the Islamist group is behind this latest attack in this
   vulnerable area.
   Since the Monday attacks many of the local Gamboru Ngala youth have
   joined an anti-Islamist vigilante force in the smoldering village. It
   was created and scores of young people are helping Nigerian military
   forces in the area.

[13]Motown Gospel’s Grammy-Nominated Recording Artist Sheri Jones-Moffett
Releases Highly Anticipated Sophomore Album, ‘Power & Authority’, Now
Available On Itunes!!

   [15]SJM_Final-Cover
   Motown Gospel’s Grammy-nominated songstress Sheri Jones-Moffett unveils
   her long awaited new album, POWER & AUTHORITY: LIVE IN MEMPHIS,
   available in stores and online today.
   Coming in as the highly anticipated follow-up to RENEWED – her
   Grammy-nominated debut album, POWER & AUTHORITY lives up to its moniker
   by assembling a collection of commanding and powerful numbers that not
   only move and inspire, but also interlace to lend a narrative of
   worship.
   “After RENEWED, I want every project that I do to tell a story about
   the space that I’m living in,” Sheri explains. “My mentor, Donald
   Lawrence, told me, ‘Let every moment stand alone. Don’t try to make the
   next moment look like this one.’”
   Such personal narrative is all the more telling via the live format
   Jones-Moffett chose for her sophomore project. Produced by her
   label-mate Grammy award-winning producer Myron Butler, POWER &
   AUTHORITY gave the singer an opportunity to truly be led into
   extemporaneous atmospheres of worship. The results of those experiences
   are ten high-spirited live recordings.
   The album’s electrifying opener, a revitalized version of the classic
   COGIC shouting tune “Keys To the Kingdom,” turns the ignition for what
   listeners will soon find is an unforgettable audio journey. Putting her
   unique twist on the tune’s arrangement, the song shines as a clear
   showcase of Moffett’s artistic and ministerial maturity. The same can
   be said for other remakes and revisits found on the project including
   revamps of Yolanda Adams’ “Wash Me,” Milton Brunson’s Thompson
   Community Choir’s hit “There Is No Failure,” and a live remake of her
   own “Grace of God” – a favorite from her inaugural project.
   Other standout tracks include the album’s first singles “Shine” and
   “Faith To Believe,” both available on iTunes. While “Shine” and its
   heartfelt lyrics continue to live up to its titling by being a beacon
   for listeners in need of spiritual uplifting, “Faith To Believe”
   follows suit with its equally palatable recipe of powerful vocal
   displays and touching lyrics accented by a love of God that simply
   emanates from the song.
   Join Jones-Moffett as she emphatically imparts worshippers the reminder
   of their true POWER & AUTHORITY via her new live album, in stores and
   online today.

   About Sheri Jones-Moffett:
   As a featured member of two of the most beloved Gospel ensembles of the
   past two decades – Donald Lawrence’s Tri-City Singers and the duo Ted &
   Sheri – Sheri Jones-Moffett carved a deep niche for herself in the
   hearts of Gospel music lovers long before the 2009 release of her solo
   debut, RENEWED. The success of that project firmly established her as
   one of the great power vocalists of the contemporary Gospel age, while
   earning a GRAMMY® nomination.
   With her sophomore album, POWER & AUTHORITY: LIVE IN MEMPHIS, Sheri
   confirms her status as a seasoned artist with trademark vocal
   inflections, distinct melodies, and life-changing messages. The 10-song
   project, produced by Grammy-award-winning producer Myron Butler, serves
   as tribute to a musical journey of more than 20 years, while testifying
   to this unique moment in Sheri’s artistry.

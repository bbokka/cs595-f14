POLITICAL EXILES TELL

[37]DOUBLE STANDARDS

   THEREALSINGAPORE 3 October 2014 - 10:13pm

   There are two Susan Lims. She is the talented surgeon who performed the
   first successful liver transplant in Asian history in 1990. You can see
   her giving a TED talk on "Transplanting Cells, Not Organs" in April
   2011, which has garnered 567,316 total views thus far. At the age of
   36, Lim rose to the prestigious position of associate professor in
   surgery. Her hands have been replicated for display at Madame Tussaud's
   Exhibition, probably in recognition of her surgical skills.

   off against a larger group of anti-protesters in Mong Kok after they
   started to dismantle barricades in an apparent backlash against the
   demonstrations, which have brought parts of the city to a standstill.

[57]REVISITING HONG KONG

   THEREALSINGAPORE 3 October 2014 - 5:53pm

   Strategically, Beijing is very limited in its options. Except for
   crossing their fingers and hoping this comes to an end, Beijing has few
   options. There would be significant back lash in Hong Kong, China, and
   internationally if significant force was used; however, if they back
   down in any significant way, they know very well they could be opening
   the door to greater problems. So far the Hong Kong and Beijing response
   seems to depend on repeating that the protests are illegal and everyone
   should go home. I doubt this will succeed in dispersing protests.

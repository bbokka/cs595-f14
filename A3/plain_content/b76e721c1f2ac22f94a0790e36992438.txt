   I have my thinking glasses on.

   Look, ma, no lenses!

   A little Michael Jackson and a lot of nerdiness goes a long way in this
   here life. Lots of opinions to express, but one thought bubble at a
   time. Now to move onto more of my social commentary.

[15]Lonely Hearts, Empty Places

   The beginning of April always brings out my woeful side. This April is
   no different.

   April 2nd, 1990 is the first of days my life was undoubtedly changed.
   There’s nothing in me that can see it as for the better, but who am I
   to question His plan, right? Still, since then, each April 2nd I came
   across with full knowledge that the day took something from me that
   will never be replaced, my April starts out rather–well, shitty.

   This April, I shouldn’t be sad though. This April I should be happy as
   I’m partaking in a graduation ceremony, well several because that’s how
   our school works. Of course, this April is marked by more of that
   second day feeling of abandonment.

   Got into it with my mom today over something pretty insignificant. As
   history tells it, that’s when things get astronomical. Interestingly
   enough. I said maybe 10 words in all of this, ending in a hasty ride
   back to Ann Arbor. Once again to be alone and abandoned. My heart is so
   heavy, my body so tense, my mind so quick that I can’t do anything but
   feel the emptiness.

   My great aunt doesn’t think she can make it to this “celebration,” my
   godmother thinks she’s too sick (and she’s actually the reason I
   planned to attend it), and my mom made me promise tickets to someone I
   have no connection too. Not to mention I completely forgot to invite my
   aunt and cousin, probably because I know she wouldn’t try to come out
   anyway. She doesn’t like me enough because I told her I disagreed with
   her at 13. My best friend won’t be making it in. Still, there’s the
   parents right? Negative. I don’t have a father and my mom pretty much
   hates me.

   Pause.

   She kind of hates me. Other times she loves me and that’s always when I
   have something physical to give. Other than that, her disdain flows
   beneath the surface of her skin and is always at the back of her tongue
   to spit at the drop of a dime. I’m a fight fair, not dirty kind of gal.
   She, on the other hand, is all for fighting dirty and says fuck being
   fair.

   While so many of my counterparts are worrying about appearing rude
   towards Rick Snyder and complaining that protesters will be ruining
   their day. I’m a bit more concerned that there’s no one else to support
   me in the stands. An empty section where my cheering family is supposed
   to be? I doubt it, families fill that mess in when no one claims their
   seats. At this point, I’m not even going to bother to buy a cap and
   gown. I have other things to trip about, like how I’m going to pay my
   bills next month with no job and no prospects.

   Oh, and passing this oral exam. And even with that I have a fucking
   partner who is leaps and bounds better than me! WTF you choose me for?!

   AND I even bought my mom some of her favorite movies because
   Blockbuster is going out of business. How’s that for a “Please talk to
   me because without you I’m lonely” semi-not really-apology?

   Significance of April 2nd? That was the day that my daddy died. Thanks
   to The Temptations.

[19]And sometimes I say…

   FUCK YOU

   I don’t know why exactly. Sometimes that’s necessary, right?

[27]When RatRats Get Access to Fashion Trends?

   Abuse.

   Della and I have decided that we’ll teach a class at Washtenaw. Title?
   “How to Use, Not Abuse, Fashion Trends” What makes us qualified? I’m
   plus-sized, she’s damn near a 0, we’re yin and yang. When I get
   dressed, I get *dressed* and she? Well Della just has it like that.

   We’re Geminis. We love to shop, love to spend, but mostly we love
   quality. We also know to recognize that lace is hot, very feminine, but
   that doesn’t mean you should be wearing: a lacy dress, lace printed
   tights, AND lace booties.

   Stop.

   You are not hitting on it, babygirl. Take things one step at a time,
   take one item of a particular trend at a certain time. Some things are
   just better in moderation, especially in fashion.

[31]What would my color be?

   This is mine, I can make my own words immortal, so here it go (read my
   stream of consciousness from the bottom up):

   My sisters, those who can never have a moment of mercy from the general
   population. I commend you for having the strength to persist.

   And praise the Lord for the loving unit, though small, from which I
   can. I didn’t need to go through the pain of my sisters’ but I feel
   them

   Praise God that my mother was able to save me from sexual abuse only
   through Him. But who saved her? Tell me.

   What a disservice I would do my sisters to not feel their pain. Some
   nignog could easily decide to send me to a shelter with some hits.

   That’s what I do on Twitter. I live out my feelings for you all, in
   hopes that I manage to connect with one, two, or a few. Sometimes
   silence is enough, you don’t know what you could be saying that really
   hits someone.  The release of “For Colored Girls” has stirred up
   emotion and on-course with seemingly every hard-hitting film with a
   predominantly Black cast in recent history, *we* have problems. So
   much dissension between women, between women and men, but I don’t know
   if it’s between men and I imagine that it is.
   -
   It’s not a blame game. (no Kanye)
   -
   It’s a state of being for some, but never an intent to make Black men
   look evil, at least that’s not how I read the play. If Tyler Perry
   distorted the vision and made it that way…Well, I don’t know what to
   say (though I will if I take 10 more minuets to let it stew).  I really
   wish people went past the face value of “colored” and really paid
   attention to the colors of the characters. It really for more than just
   Colored girls.
   -
   If I was a color, what would I be? I wonder if I would be vibrant, kind
   of bubbly, but with the intensity that reads as a color like magenta?
   Something darker, a bit more moody, kind of cold and a little empty
   like gray?  I’d probably cheat and try to be a gradient, I’m so hard to
   read.  What would you be?
   -
   I love my little world of binaries, but there are many external factors
   I hope to be an instrument for change.

[53]You always got on some fly, blue suit

   And your cuff links are always shinin’ all bright.

   That’s when Alicia taught us ladies how to spit game.

   You know, I do look– a lot different outside my work clothes.

   The bassline?  Just navigating us along smoothly, giving highs and
   lows, like a relationship right?  Just pushing along the dialogue,
   dipping in-between the lyrics, propelling the listener through the
   anxiety of that new thing.

   So what day did you say?…Thursday’s perfect, man.

   That’s right, girl, if he didn’t give you an answer, go ahead and put
   it out there so he doesn’t say, “No.” Still not desperate, just
   clarifying a few things.

   Baby, I swear, it’s like ohhhhOhhhhohhhh, but you don’t know my name.

   If only you knew my name, right?  As far as I’m concerned, this is the
   song that will make me know Alicia’s name for the rest of my life.
   Hopefully my life won’t continuously play out like this though. Too
   much anxiety.

   I'm an award-winning [15]children’s book author with seven titles
   published by American Girl. My freelance writing business launched in
   2011 with two specific goals: work on projects I love and travel more.
   When not writing craft and activity books or short stories for kids, I
   work with my favorite publications and brands as a [16]freelance tech
   and travel writer, [17]marketing copywriter, and [18]social media
   consultant. WIRED, Mashable, National Geographic Traveler, and
   FamilyFun are just a few of my clients.
   My unique background has turned me into a triple threat of marketing
   savviness, journalistic integrity, and creativity, and my past clients
   have called me “an expert on branding,” “the best person for the job,”
   and “extremely gifted.” (Aww, thanks!). Find me [19]tweeting,
   [20]Instagramming, and writing from coffee shops in Chicago or around
   the globe when I'm traveling.

   I've developed and styled crafts, recipes, and parties for national
   magazines, books, and retail stores since 2006. I’m also the author of
   craft, party, and activity books for kids published by American Girl.
   Pretty in Paper, which I styled front to back, won the Oppenheim Toy
   Portfolio 2014 Gold Seal Award in the Best Book Category.
   Thanks to my rigorous craft training as an editor at American Girl, I
   can karate chop my way through any monotonous month to find a fresh
   spin on seasonal activities, recipes, and party ideas for your
   publication. I dream up age-appropriate and easy-to-understand
   activities that actually work. I've worked as a craft, prop, food, and
   wardrobe stylist on location and in the studio at photo shoots around
   the country.

   I’ve written seven non-fiction books for kids published by American
   Girl covering everything from babysitting to quizzes to slumber parties
   to crafts. See my craft styling on display in Pretty in Paper, which
   the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awarded a 2014 Gold Seal Award in the Best
   Book Category. Speaking of awards, the California Reading Association
   gave Slumber Wonders a Eureka! Silver Honor Award in 2012. I’m also a
   soon-to-be published short story writer for kids – you’ll just have to
   wait until 2016 to read it. Hire me for [24]in-school and virtual Skype

   I launched my freelance writing business specifically so I could travel
   more. I've worked from Istanbul, Siem Reap, and Budapest among other
   fantastical places. My food and travel writing has appeared in National
   Geographic Traveler, Huffington Post Travel, and Eater. Whether I’m
   exploring my hometown of Chicago or gallivanting around the world, I
   plan my days around what I’m going to eat next. Life is best explored
   through food. Every meal has a story.

   As a trained journalist and former newspaper editor, I’m not afraid to
   pick up the phone or step on the scene. And I know how to write a
   compelling story. I’ve interviewed everyone from kids to celebrities on
   everything from cupcakes to crime and my features have appeared in
   American Girl, Mashable, the Wisconsin State Journal, National
   Geographic Traveler and more.
   I discovered my love for writing in college while sitting at the city
   desk of The Badger Herald daily newspaper. Here's my j-school advice:
   get out of the classroom and into a newsroom.

   I love to help brilliant people get their businesses off the ground the
   only way I know how: with words.
   Lets work together to create a brand story – I can start from scratch
   or fine-tune what you already have – that communicates your mission to
   both potential investors and customers. One client says, “Her
   copyediting and content creation have helped close multiple deals and
   effectively message our value proposition.” I’d say that’s a worthy
   investment!

   Don't have enough time for social media? At least not enough time to do
   it well? Since 2011, I've run social media campaigns for 25+ brands big
   and small, and before that I was a social media copywriter at EXPRESS,
   the international fashion retailer. I also frequently write about
   social media and tech for Mashable and WIRED.
   I can fully manage your social media presences, build them from the
   ground up, or give you a one-time consulting session where I develop a
   social media strategy for your business. One happy client says, "I
   expanded my own knowledge of social media strategy by one thousand
   percent!" I speak Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram
   fluently and focus on personal branding, product marketing, and company
   pages through copy, contests, and ads. [36]Read my FAQ on social media

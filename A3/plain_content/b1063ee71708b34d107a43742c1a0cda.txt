[[40]edit] General Info

     "I, magical girl Sayaka Miki, will protect the people of Mitakihara
     Town, until the very end!" - Sayaka Miki, [41]Episode 5.

     * Madoka’s classmate and good friend. Energetic and lively, which is
       perhaps why her sword is the only melee weapon among the four.
     * Ms. Aoki’s Design Check!: Her personality is so boyish that I had
       to be careful not to make her look too boyish too. So I gave her
       hair a diagonal line in back, to straddle the line between short
       and medium length.
     * Magical girl outfit: Sayaka’s outfit is the closest to combat gear.
       Since her sword is a melee weapon, I paid attention to that while
       designing her clothes. (Aoki)
          + Her outfit features diagonal-cut skirt and shoulderless top
            for ease of movement. Add a cape, and she’s a picturesque
            swordswoman.
     * Sayaka's height range, according to the [42]Production Note, is
       [43]158-160cm. Her birthday, blood type and other biographical
       information is unknown at this time.
     * Sayaka has powerful regenerative abilities, she can heal herself
       much faster than any other magical girls.
     * Sayaka becomes a magical girl in Episode 4; Episode 5 details her
       debut as a magical girl, including the scene where she makes the
       contract with [44]Kyubey.
     * Sayaka turns into a witch named [45]Oktavia von Seckendorff in
       Episode 8. While she has brought hope to others, the balance
       between hope and despair is then mitigated by an equal amount of
       despair appearing in Sayaka's soul. This despair eventually
       overcomes Sayaka, shatters her Soul Gem, and turns it into a Grief
       Seed.
     * Her witch form was killed by Kyoko in Episode 9; Madoka and Kyoko
       attempted to bring Sayaka back to her normal form, but according to
       Kyubey that was impossible. But the quote (below) is true.

     "None, as far as I know anyway." - Kyubey, [46]Episode 9.

     * Sayaka remains dead in the new timeline created by Madoka in the
       final episode, though Madoka grants her final wish to hear Kyousuke
       play violin. From Mami and Kyoko's perspective, it appears as
       though she sacrificed herself to destroy a Demon.
     * Madoka and Sayaka are childhood friends, [47]the NitroPlus novel
       goes into detail regarding their encounter and their friendship.
          + In the movie opening, it shows scenes of Madoka's life. Sayaka
            is shown with Hitomi and Kyousuke along the way.
     * Color Theme: Blue.
     * Soul Gem shape: C-shape, similar to a cresent moon.
     * Elemental Themes: Water and Music.

[[48]edit] Personality

   Tomboyish, brave, idealistic, stubborn, self righteous, music lover,
   protective, devoted friend - for the most part - , wanting to be loved.

[[49]edit] History

[[50]edit] Sayaka in the Anime and Drama CDs

     * The [51]"Sunny Day Life" Drama CD depicts Sayaka checking Hitomi's
       panties with dubious interest. Making her look like some sort of
       pervert.
          + Even Madoka knows this is wrong.

[[52]edit] Sayaka in Oriko Magica

     "Madoka, what are you planning to do when you get there? I have no
     idea why Homura is out there fighting, but...you can't do /a thing
     to help, right Madoka? You'd end up getting in her way. That's
     why...'Sayaka-san' is going in as backup."

     "We're friends, right? I can't just let [53]her be." - Sayaka Miki,
     [54]Puella Magi Oriko Magica, Chapter 7.

     * Sayaka is mentioned in Chapter 3. She does not appear until chapter
       4, however. Sayaka is also protected by [55]Homura so that she
       never gets contracted there.
     * Unlike the other timelines, she considers Homura as a friend, as
       she declared in chapter 7.
     * She helped Hitomi to escape from familiars' attacks from chapter
       5-7, when Mitakihara Junior High is covered with a witch's barrier.
       Madoka reunites with them, and together, they go to help Homura.
       Madoka is killed by Oriko, and Sayaka and Hitomi are seen mourning
       her just before Homura resets the timeline.

[[56]edit] Sayaka in Kazumi Magica

   Sayaka's and Oktavia's silhouettes appeared once during Umika's
   explanation about Witches, as she says that witches are the end state
   of magical girls.

[[57]edit] Sayaka in Madoka Magica: The Different Story

   Sayaka acts more like a perfectionist than she did in other media. She
   often obsesses over the mistakes that she makes and is very conscious
   of other people's expectations.
     * In this manga, Sayaka tries to escape when Mami requests that she
       study magic to find witches efficiently.
     * It is shown that Sayaka can also heal others in this story.
     * Sayaka appears in the later part of chapter 4. In chapter 7, it is
       shown that Sayaka makes contract and prevents Mami from danger.
     * When Hitomi tells her that she will confess to Kyousuke, Sayaka's
       sense of responsibility as a magical girl prevents her from confess
       first. Again, she is unable to bear her own selfishness, especially
       when she didn't help Hitomi who was in witch's trap.
     * In chapter 8, Sayaka exhausted her magic and becomes a witch.
       According to Kyubey, she is too weak to gain any good when there
       are many more powerful magical girls.
     * In final chapter, Sayaka is revived by Madoka, who made the
       contract with Kyubey. Sayaka does not remember being transformed
       into a witch, just Madoka saved her from being killed by a witch.
       Before facing Walpurgis Night, Sayaka apologizes with Homura,
       saying she had misunderstood her actions and what the two want is
       to protect Madoka. Also, Sayaka says she owes Homura for saving her
       life once and she'll find a way to thank her. She is last seen
       facing Walpurgis Night before Homura restart time.

[[58]edit] Sayaka in the [59]PSP Game

     * There is a [60]Sayaka route in the game, which is different from
       the anime. The scenario is supervised by Gen Urobuchi who wrote the
       script for the anime series. But there are multiple different 'if'
       developments. There is a different 'Sayaka route', in which it is
       possible to prevent Sayaka from becoming a witch. She may fight
       with other magical girls.
          + It is possible to have a better ending, or to have a more
            cruel one than the anime, depending on the player's choices.

                 Warning, this section contains spoilers.
   It is possible to stop Sayaka's insanity and her transformation into a
   witch in the Sayaka route or [61]Homura route of the PSP Game.
     * Kyoko can prevent Sayaka from becoming a witch.
     * In the Bonus Route, Sayaka has a confrontation with Hitomi about
       Kyousuke. After that, she confesses Kyosuke about her feelings and
       her identity as a Magical Girl.

[[62]edit] Sayaka in the [63]The Battle Pentagram

   Coming soon...

[[64]edit] Sayaka in [65]The Rebellion Story

           Warning, this section contains spoilers about the movie.

   [[66]edit] [67]Homulilly's barrier

      Prior to the beginning of the movie, the Incubators trap Homura's Soul
      Gem in an Isolation Field that blocks out the Law of Cycles, causing a
      barrier to form within the Soul Gem. After Kyubey modifies the Field to
      allow the barrier to "invite" victims, Sayaka enters the barrier from
      the Law of Cycles along with Madoka and [68]Nagisa Momoe. (Although the
      movie doesn't explicitly say this, Sayaka is essentially an angel for
      Madoka.) To prevent the Incubators from observing the Law of Cycles
      (which would give them the information they need to reinstate the witch
      system), Madoka entrusts her memories and powers to Sayaka and Nagisa.

      Homura's witch barrier is a false, idealized Mitakihara that alters the
      memories of the humans trapped in it. Sayaka is unaffected by the
      memory alterations (either due to being part of the Law of Cycles or
      because she was entrusted with Madoka's memories), but plays along in
      order to fool Kyubey. When the movie begins, Sayaka is once again a
      student at Mitakihara Middle School and fights alongside the other
      magical girls against [69]Nightmares, monsters created by the barrier
      specifically to provide an enemy for the magical girls to fight. She is
      shown to be much closer to Kyoko, who is now Sayaka and Madoka's
      classmate; in fact Kyoko is staying at Sayaka's house.

      Although she is pretending to have her memories erased, Sayaka acts
      more well-adjusted than she did in the anime. It's implied she has
      memories of all of the previous timelines. When Hitomi gives birth to a
      Nightmare out of her frustration with Kyosuke, Sayaka jokes that Hitomi
      chose an insensitive boyfriend. After the Nightmare is defeated, Sayaka
      is the one who purifies Hitomi.

      When Homura begins to discover the truth of the barrier, she suspects
      [70]Bebe, Nagisa's disguised form. This puts Homura into conflict with
      Mami, which ends with Homura incapacitated. Sayaka saves Homura and
      chides her for picking a fight with Mami and suspecting Bebe. When
      Homura tries to stop time Sayaka prevents it from happening by
      thrusting her sword into Homura's shield. She chides Homura again for
      relying too much on her time magic. Sayaka then discusses the nature of
      the barrier with Homura, causing Homura to realize the witch must be
      one of the five magical girls. Sayaka asks Homura if it's alright to
      kill someone that just wants a world where everyone can be happy.
      Instead of answering, Homura remembers that Sayaka shouldn't exist, and
      asks her who she is. Sayaka responds by saying that she's exactly who
      Homura thinks she is. Homura then sees Oktavia reflected in a puddle
      the girls are standing on, prompting her to attack Sayaka. Sayaka
      escapes, but tells Homura to think about whether she really wants to
      destroy the false Mitakihara, as it would be bad if Homura had any
      regrets.

      Eventually Homura realizes she is the witch and becomes Homulilly.
      Kyubey tells Madoka to reveal her true powers in order to save Homura,
      but Sayaka tells Madoka not to listen to him. She stabs herself in
      order to summon Oktavia and an army of familiars from other witches.
      The summoned familiars battle Homulilly's familiars, while Oktavia
      holds off Homulilly herself. The other magical girls either fight off
      Homulilly's familiars or attack the ceiling of the barrier, cracking
      it. During the battle, Sayaka is rescued by Kyoko and admits that she
      regretted abandoning Kyoko at the end of the anime. The two girls then
      fight off familiars together, and Oktavia even uses Kyoko's spear to
      punch another hole in Homulilly's barrier. Finally Madoka shatters the
      ceiling of the barrier and exposes Kyubey's Isolation Field. She
      reaches out to Homura's remaining Humanity, and together they destroy
      the Isolation Field from within.

      Once the barrier vanishes, Ultimate Madoka descends from the sky to
      retrieve Homura's Soul Gem. Sayaka and Nagisa descend alongside her in
      a carriage. However, Homura has been changed by her experience in the
      barrier and grabs Madoka before she can erase Homura's Soul Gem.
      Homura's actions tear apart reality and seperate Madoka from her
      goddess self. Sayaka is engulfed by colors that erupt from Homura's
      Soul Gem and spread across the universe.

   [[71]edit] Akuma Homura's Universe

      Tensions rising!

        "Even if you say that, I won’t forget this: you, Akemi Homura, have
        become a devil!"

      Now a self-proclaimed demon, Homura creates a new universe. For unknown
      reasons, Sayaka is the only one who retains her memories. Also, she can
      no longer return to the Law of Cycles. She confronts Homura, asking her
      why she stole a fragment of the Law of Cycles. Homura replied that she
      only stole Madoka's existence as a human. Homura says that as a demon,
      it's only appropriate she goes against god. Sayaka summons Oktavia
      again and asks Homura if she wants to destroy the universe. Homura says
      it's a fine idea once all the wraiths are destroyed, and when the time
      comes she'll gladly be their enemy. Homura then asks if Sayaka really
      can oppose her and claps her hands, causing Oktavia to vanish. Homura
      tells Sayaka that her memories are being altered. Sayaka says she
      remembers that she was somewhere else and part of something greater,
      but she can't remember what it felt like. Homura tells her to just let
      go and accept returning to her human life, but Sayaka says that
      although her memories are gone, there is one thing she will never
      forget: that Homura Akemi is a demon. Despite the threat, Homura says
      that they should at least pretend to be friends in front of Madoka.

      Homura vanishes, and Sayaka is greeted by Hitomi and Kyosuke. Even
      though she lost her memories, she says she feels really happy to be
      greeted by the two. Hitomi says that Sayaka is saying strange things,
      and Sayaka agrees with a laugh. A shot of Sayaka's hand reveals that
      her ring and Soul Gem mark are still present. However, the [72]Runes
      displaying her name have vanished, indicating her powers are gone or
      sealed. At the end of the movie Sayaka is seen enjoying pocky with
      Kyoko, indicating they are still close in this new world.

[[73]edit] Trivia

     "I have made up my mind to become a type of magical girl different
     than you all. I have decided that I won't associate myself with
     those who use and abandon others. I don't need to be rewarded for my
     work. I'll never use magic for my own benefit."
     "I will die when I lose by witches. That's well, I'm not needed any
     more if I'm unable to defeat witches." - Sayaka Miki, [74]Episode 8.

     * The first character in her last name (美) means "beauty". The last
       character (樹) means "tree". Her name could also be written (幹)
       "tree trunk" or (神酒) "sake offered to the gods."
     * Her last name can also be used as a first name.
     * Her first name is written in hiragana, which has no special
       meaning. The word sayaka (さやか【明か／清か, usually written in hiragana)
       can mean "clear", "fresh", or "bright" in Japanese.
     * The official [75]Chinese translation uses (沙耶香) as the kanji for
       her name. The characters also have no particular meaning (沙 "sand"
       耶 "question mark" 香 "fragrant") and are used mainly for their
       phonetic value in Japanese to represent the word sayaka as a name.
       No official kanji of her name exists in the original Japanese
       version.
          + One Chinese fan translation has her name as (爽), which means
            "fresh" or "bright".
     * She describes herself as having been born "petit bourgeois," which
       is French for "[76]petty bourgeois." This would mean that her
       family is at least from the middle class, but is by no means from
       the upper class (despite the fact that, if Japan has even less
       living space in the future than it does now, her family's apartment
       is far larger than a normal middle-class family could afford).
     * Although her character design depicts her with a two-edged sword
       she is seen using a katana with a saber-like guard in the anime.
       The manga uses the sword from her original design.
     * According to recent interview, "Sayaka had her personality based on
       a 'Gen Urobuchi character'"
          + In episode 5, Madoka said she always act before thinking
            twice, and is easy to conflict with others. But on the other
            side, she is kind, courageous and willing to work hard for
            others. Homura commented her good side is fatal for a magical
            girl. Her kindness makes her ignorant, her courage makes her
            careless, and she'll get no return on her hard work for
            others.
     * When Sayaka transformed in the train in Episode 8, the fate of the
       two hosts was open to interpretation in the original scenario by
       Gen Urobuchi. While Shinbo has recently confirmed that Sayaka did
       not kill the two men in the anime, they were in fact killed in the
       manga version.
          + The train conversation scene between the two hosts is actually
            based on a real event that [77]Gen Urobuchi witnessed.
     * Shinbo stated in an interview that he liked Sayaka and asked Gen
       Urobuchi if something could be done to get her back to life but
       Urobuchi said that was impossible.
          + It is unknown if Gen Urobuchi had a twisted smile while he
            answered to Shinbo.
     * Sayaka's sword has a [78]scabbard but was never used in the anime.
     * Sayaka's hairpin disappears when she transforms into magical girl
       form.
          + According to [79]Official Guidebook, both Shinbo and Aoki
            think it would be better to attach something instead. Aoki has
            tried adding another hairband with something in star or ball
            shape, but that would make her look like playing in a serious
            fight so she gave up such idea. Urobuchi said a cloak is
            flashy enough, however.
               o [80]Manga Time Kirara Magica volume 1 showed Sayaka in
                 her transformed state with a [81]new hairpin in the shape
                 of ƒƒ, the musical notation for "fortissimo" or "very
                 loud." This fits her musical theme and her bold
                 personality. Apparently the staff finally found a design
                 they're happy with.
                    # And finally the staff have the chance to give her
                      that hairpin in the [82]Madoka Magica Movie.
                      According to Director Shinbo, this can be seem as
                      compensation for her since she is such a character
                      always suffers the fate.
     * Eri Kitamura (Sayaka) [83]likes the company of other seiyuu,
       besides Ai Nonaka ([84]Kyoko).
     * According with Gen Urobuchi, even if Sayaka won over Kyousuke,
       [85]she would never be happy with him.
          + This doesnt seem to bother [86]the yurifan crowd.
     * Her Seiyuu, Eri Kitamura also provided the voice of another Magical
       Girl whose first name was Miki and whose theme color was blue, in
       the anime series 'Fresh PreCure'
     * In an interview, when asked about Madoka's casual clothes, Shinbo
       said that he forgot to have a scene where Sayaka also wear casual
       wears. He feels a little regret.
          + As compensation, Sayaka wears casual clothes in
            [87]Rebellion's OP.

[[88]edit] Speculations and Observations

     "Wishing for someone else's happiness means someone has to be cursed
     to suffer as much. That's what it means to be a magical girl." -
     Sayaka Miki, [89]Episode 8.

     * Many fans believed Sayaka is the [90]witch in Madoka's dream at the
       beginning of Episode 1. However, this has been disproved by
       [91]Sayaka's witch form hinted in [92]Episode 8 and shown in full
       in [93]Episode 9, which is entirely different in appearance from
       the witch Madoka saw.
     * While using her magic, [94]circles of notes are sometimes seen
       around or near her. This is believed to be related to her wish to
       heal [95]Kamijou.
          + Due to the nature of her wish, Sayaka has self-healing
            abilities and great endurance. In battle, she can combine this
            self-healing special ability with magical techniques that
            detach her senses and block all forms of pain, becoming a
            nearly unstoppable berserker.
     * School uniform: Her figure is flat and plain, but her chest is
       bigger than Madoka’s. Her hairbow is a stitched design. Below, she
       wears simple navy-blue high socks.
     * Sayaka seems to have had an extremely black-and-white and
       idealistic vision of love, which seems to have contributed to her
       breakdown. She made a contract to heal the arm of the boy she has a
       crush on (Kamijou), but after learning the truth about the Magical
       Girl contract, she felt that she couldn't approach him, and this
       wasn't helped by Kamijou's obliviousness to her feelings and
       Hitomi's more assertive behavior that ended up with Hitomi becoming
       Kamijou's girlfriend, unaware of Sayaka's problem. This threw her
       in a self-destructive spiral, in which she refused help from others
       (especially Kyoko, Homura and Madoka), seeking to either die or
       kill to dull the pain.
     * Sayaka is the only magical girl in the series to wear a cloak.
          + The cloak or cape could be symbolic to emphasize her ideal
            role as a knight of justice or a hero to the defenseless; a
            desire to become a role model just like Mami.
     * The cutlass is a well-known nautical weapon for sailors and
       pirates, probably an attempt to connect Sayaka to the element of
       water.
          + Water is usually considered to be an element of healing and
            purification in religion and mythology. Major faiths
            incorporate ritual washing.
     * The "C" Motif could relate to the link between her and music. In
       [96]Medieval music, the [97]Gregorian Chant system uses a C-like
       figure to denote a "[98]Do" in a staff.
     * It seems Sayaka does not always contract with Kyubey in all
       timelines. What happened to her if she does not contract is
       unknown. But once she get contracted, her fate is always becoming a
       witch.
     * The grief seed, which Madoka used for purifying Homura's Soul Gem
       in Episode 10's Timeline 3, may be Sayaka herself (likely to be
       transformed from Sayaka's Soul Gem and recovered after Homura
       destroyed Oktavia von Seckendorff). This is because the 5 lines
       being seen on grief seed look like the musical Staff.
          + This theory is supported by the fact that the emblem of
            Sayaka's Soul Gem can be seen at the top of this Grief Seed;
            furthermore the Grief Seed heavily resembles the depiction of
            Oktavia's Grief Seed from the PSP Game.
     * The Blu-Ray version of Sayaka's transformation is accompanied with
       a display of musical scores and [99]circles of notes.
          + It is suspected that the notes are from [100]Tekla
            Bądarzewska-Baranowska's [101]A Maiden's Prayer ([102]乙女の祈り)
               o The irony wont be missed with those familiar with Kyoko's
                 prayer in Episode 9.
               o The [103]lyrics of the song could be interpreted as
                 Sayaka's prayer for a miracle to heal [104]Kyousuke's
                 hand and the foreshadowing of her tragic ending with her
                 wish.
     * Sayaka calls other main characters their first names only, except
       Homura and Mami.
          + The way she calls Homura varies in every timeline. This
            reflects how she sees Homura.
          + In the novel, it is written that Sayaka is easy to get
            familiar with her classmates and talk to them.
     * The [105]Drama CD "Sunny Day Life" gives the impression that Sayaka
       is not a bright student.
          + It gets worse, even if Madoka's test scores are low, they are
            higher than Sayaka's.
               o We usually see Sayaka sleeping in class. No wonder she
                 gets low scores.

[[106]edit] Sayaka's Farewell

     "It's fine. I just wanted to hear him perform one more time. I
     wanted many people to hear his violin. Just remembering that feeling
     is enough for me. I don't have any regrets left."
     "But I am a bit upset about how things turned out. I can't help the
     way things went with Hitomi-chan. She's way too good for Kyosuke,
     but I am sure she'll make him happy, won't she?" Sayaka's last
     conversation with Madoka, [107]Episode 12.

     * Sayaka still dies in the new world, but this time she passes
       without regrets from her choice.
     * Even though Sayaka is the only supporting character of the series
       to remain dead in the new world created by Madoka (due to using all
       her magic), the fact that Sayaka and Madoka were able to meet up
       one last time to watch Kamijou's violin playing, along with the
       nature of Madoka's wish, has resulted in many fans suggesting that
       Sayaka's soul, although erased from the world, now resides in the
       same plane of existence that Madoka inhabits, where she will watch
       over all the other magical girls along with Madoka.
          + Of course, this could be because Madoka personally visited
            every Magical Girl in all of time before they turned into
            Witches and instead let them merely die, before she was erased
            from reality as a regular girl.. She could easily have taken
            Sayaka to see Kamijou perform Ave Maria during this brief
            meeting. She did become a goddess, after all.
          + According with Mami and her understanding of "The Law of
            Wheels", as a result of a magical girl having sought a wish
            brings despair into the world, her spirit disappears before
            that happens.
          + It is suggested that Madoka's presence is there to help Sayaka
            to move on, to help her ease her ending so she would have no
            regrets.
               o Madoka informs Sayaka that she could have changed
                 Sayaka's fate but in doing so she would have interfered
                 with Kyosuke's fate as well and he wouldnt be able to
                 play the violin. So Madoka decided to respect Sayaka's
                 choice and tearfully Sayaka is fine with it.
     * In the new timeline created by Madoka, she is not only allowed to
       listen to Kyousuke's performance, but she is also given the choice
       to become a knight of justice to the very end, erasing her fate of
       becoming a witch, an enemy of her beliefs in her mind.
          + It appears that Sayaka also remembers who Madoka is in the new
            timeline created by the latter. This is due to Sayaka's choice
            of words when conversing with Madoka in episode 12; while
            watching Kamijou play the violin in a private session, Sayaka
            confesses to Madoka that she has caused her best friend a lot
            of trouble. This suggests that Sayaka is aware, or at least
            has some understanding of the emotional hurt she had inflicted
            on Madoka (and possibly her other friends) in the previous
            timelines because of her stubbornness to hold true to her own
            ideals, which led to her Witch transformation.
               o In that scene, Madoka says, "No, I have to apologize,
                 too. To save you I had to erase it all. And this future
                 will disappear, too." This suggests that the scene
                 happens before the universe resets. The Miki Sayaka of
                 the new world may not remember Madoka.
                    # It's all metaphysics, who is to say at this point.
                         @ The Rebellion Story confirms Sayaka remembers
                           all the previous timelines.
     * At the Otakon 2012 panel, Urobuchi explained the reason why Sayaka
       had to die, "This was something that director Shinbo proposed at
       one of the dubbing sessions, that Sayaka Miki could've been kept
       alive in the story. But my conviction was that in order for the
       audience to really understand why Madoka became a God at the end,
       it was important that she die. After all was said and done, Shinbo
       said to me that the amount of responsibility placed on a middle
       school girl may have been too much. We explore that more in the
       movie."[108][1].

[[155]edit] Miscellaneous

     * Her gem has a c-shaped(?) motif.
     * Sayaka's transformation into a witch.
     * Screenshots off which the redrawings are based on.
     * The grief seed, which Madoka used for purifying [156]Homura's Soul
       Gem in [157]Episode 10's Timeline 3, may be Sayaka herself(obtained
       after Homura defeated Oktavia von Seckendorff, Sayaka's witch
       form). It bears some resemblance to Oktavia's Grief Seed from the
       PSP game and has what appears to be a musical staff on it, tieing
       in with Sayaka's musical symbolism.
     * Sayaka turns into a witch in manga. (Turned 90 degrees)
     * According to the [158]Puella Magi Production Note, Sayaka's sword
       is similar to Kyoko's spear in which the blade can break in linked
       pieces. It could be use to wrap an enemy with it.
     * According to the [159]Guidebook, Sayaka's sword may be used as a
       dynamite projector. This looks more like the way in Kamen Rider
       than in Mahou Shoujo.
     * Sayaka's room from production notes.
     * Sayaka's revised fortissimo hairpin in [160]Manga Time Kirara
       Magica volume 1.

Bobby Caples’ Cooking

Bobby Caples Cooking:

   Before the days when downloading TV shows, Hulu, and Netflix ruled his
   TV set (which itself eventually went the way of the past), Bobby Caples
   actually watched cable TV. One of the benefits of cable over streaming
   or downloading is you have the opportunity to stumble across more
   random viewing experiences. One afternoon in 2005, Bobby Caples met Ina
   Garten. Ms. Garten was unassuming and unpretentious (despite having a
   house in the Hamptons) – a prerequisite for Mr. Caples continuing
   engagement with her and her cooking show. Ina soon introduced him to
   (another) Bobby, Alton, Rachael, Giada, and more folks who showed him
   that his growing taste for good food could still be possible within a
   grad school budget. Bobby Caples didn’t necessarily love everyone he
   watched (sorry Sandra), but he definitely learned.

   Bobby Caples first experiences with cooking came in college, purely out
   of necessity.Somehow he made it an entire year with a gas grill chained
   to my college dorm without the fire marshall levying sanctions, and a
   grill is naturally the first place a man learns to cook. Cheese-covered
   kabobs could only go so far, and by the time he had reached his
   mid-twenties, burgeoning foodie cultural and boredom got together and
   urged Mr. Caples to learn more. Ina and friends were there to meet the
   challenge. Back on his dorm grill, even when keeping it simple Bobby
   Caples never followed recipes. It wasn’t really an eccentric thing – he
   just didn’t feel like reading that closely at 9 on a Friday night.
   Also, he never seemed to have what the recipe called for, but had a few
   other things that looked close.

   Also relevant was that Bobby Caples was not sure any of dorm dwellers
   had any measuring devices, pretty much ensuring that experimentation
   was the name of the game. With a firm foundation in experimental dorm
   room grilling, he was primed for the world of Food TV when every
   episode offered at least one new tip on how to not burn a quiche or
   overcook lamb. Bobby Caples also gravitated toward the shows and hosts
   who taught technique over recipes. Even Rachael on 30 minute meals
   could deliver. He’d largely ignore the overall message of the show, and
   focus on the little tips and tricks that could be exported and used the
   next night with friends. Like many things, it being a social experience
   also helped.

   Somehow Bobby Caples became friends that year of his internship with
   other people who were growing food nerds. A friend of his across the
   street actually had a multiple course, catered dinner with wine
   pairings every holiday, complete with wait staff – all in his house.
   And they were under 30. Yes, they were nerds, but when the fever takes
   hold, it takes hold.

    Friday nights eventually became more about cooking than clubbing, and
   the process of preparing a meal during those nights became more and
   more involved. What started as, “Why don’t you come over for dinner?”
   eventually turned into every guest becoming an active part of the
   cooking process. The joke (which continues to be true to this day) was
   that you need to eat before coming over for dinner because it would be
   many hours of slaving (and drinking) in the kitchen before you’d ever
   see a bit of prepared food.

   That year eventually ended, but the fire never died. Bobby Caples spent
   some years cooking more than others since 2005, but if he’s going to
   get together with friends (and not out doing music/DJ stuff), chances
   are it’s going to be around a hot stove.

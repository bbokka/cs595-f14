[37]Good Governance, Accountability And Even Development, My Priority- Ochei

   5:53 am  Markson Gboru  [38]No comments

   Good Governance, Accountability And Even Development, My Priority-
   Ochei

   A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)Governorship aspirant and former
   Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Rt Hon(Engr.) Victor
   Ochei says the essence of his gubernatorial ambition is to provide good
   governance, accountability, unity and peace, job creation, and even
   development irrespective of tribe, gender or religion, come 2015.

   This was disclosed while addressing the Delta state Leader and Elders
   Forum in Warri recently, during a consultative session, where he
   further opined that these agenda will be the cornerstone of viable
   development with the ultimate aim of making the state one that all will
   be proud of.

   The Speaker emeritus also hinted that he desires a state devoid of
   ethnicity as a divisive force but rather the diversity should be the
   driving force in strengthening the bond of brotherhood amongst Deltans.

   According to him, this dream can be actualised through the
   forum which is a formidable voice that can immensely accentuate the
   message of hope which the group had always advocated for Delta state.

   He also pledged to ensure participatory governance, based on the core
   principles of accountability and synergising development programmes
   across the state whereby the abundant human and material resources are
   properly harnessed.

   In his response, Professor Okobia expressed delight at the prospects of
   having a governorship aspirant in the mould of Ochei, whose lofty
   achievements as the immediate past speaker of the Delta state
   Legislature will enhance governance in the state, adding that “we hope
   that our hopes will be hopeful”

[48]Ello: A New Social Media Site Threatens Facebook

   12:27 pm  Markson Gboru  [49]No comments

   Ello: New Social Media Site Threatens Facebook Ello is a new
   social-networking site trying to battle Facebook. There is a new social
   networking platform in town and it offers one thing that people have
   been asking Facebook: No ads. Ello is a new, ad-free social networking
   site that many believe poses a threat to Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook.
   Launched six weeks ago, Ello is not yet fully functional and is still
   in its beta phase. Like Us on Facebook However, people who want to
   experience what Ello offers can only access the site once if they get
   invited. There are over 35,000 invites every hour and according to
   sources, users can set up their profile in just a few minutes. The new
   social networking site's features, many described, are user-friendly
   and edgy. Word has also gotten around that Ello's Silicon Valley
   programmers are luring younger people and users to switch to their
   site. Recent figures show that more than 31,000 people are switching to
   Ello every hour because the new social networking platform mirrors what
   Facebook was when it first started. Facebook was designed as a
   communication- hangout platform for the youth, but later on discovered
   by older and much younger demographics that defeated its original
   purpose. Emerson College's digital marketing professor David Gerzof
   Richard said he has heard some great reviews from people who have tried
   the new platform. He said people think it has an artistic feel and find
   it appealing. By contrast, Facebook is like a coloring book where
   people have had to "color between the lines", said Richard. However,
   last week, the new site was down for almost 45 minutes as reports
   suggest it has been hacked and a message displayed on the users'
   screens read Distributed Denial of Service". The programmers were able
   to resolve the issue as they have blocked the IP addresses of the
   hackers who attacked the website. Ello is reportedly standing pat on
   their goal to make the site advertisement-free, although it remains
   unclear how the site plans to monetize its operations to make it
   profitably viable. Experts are now asking where Ello would get their
   funds as maintaining a site requires money. During Facebook's early
   days, it started out without ads. By 2006, it opened its doors to
   advertisers with prospects of generating and increasing the site's
   revenue. Meanwhile, Ello developers are okay with users not wanting to
   share any information about themselves, which also addresses the
   privacy issue that Facebook has been saddled with in recent years. The
   programmers and designers of the new platform is yet to comment on this
   and will update as soon as we get word.

[51]Win10 Download NOW!!

   12:23 pm  Markson Gboru  [52]No comments

   Microsoft has realesed the ISO file for windows 10 and you can get them
   here. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso NB-The
   easiest way to convert an ISO file to a DVD is to use Windows Disc
   Image Burner. Remember, trying out an early build like this can be
   risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on
   your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or
   even delete your files, so you should back up everything. If you want
   to stop using Windows Technical Preview and return to your previous
   version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from
   the recovery or installation media that came with your PC—typically a
   DVD. If you don't have recovery media, you might be able to create
   recovery media from a recovery partition on your PC using software
   provided by your PC manufacturer. You'll need to do this before you
   upgrade. Check the support section of your PC manufacturer's website
   for more info. After you install Windows Technical Preview, you won’t
   be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your
   previous version of Windows.

[71]Microsoft Dumps Windows 9, Introduces Windows 10

   6:02 am  Markson Gboru  [72]No comments

   Windows 9 will no longer become a reality and has been replaced with
   Windows 10. The new OS is expected to be released sometime next year,
   and it’s designed to run across any kind of device you can think of.
   From 4-inch display to 80-inch, Microsoft expects users to have a
   seamless interaction with the OS.
   “Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform ever,”
   Windows chief Terry Myerson said at a briefing with reporters in San
   Francisco. “It wouldn’t be right to call it Windows 9,” he continued.
   The launch of Windows 10 next year would arguably be Microsoft biggest
   OS launch ever as the OS would be launching simultaneously on PCs,
   phones and tablets. All of these will complete the unifying process of
   Microsoft products under a single OS.
   Early preview of Windows 10 shows the integration of of Windows 7 and
   Windows 8 design features, beautifully crafted to give users the best
   OS experience ever. The most requested Start Menu returns while user
   interface features of Windows 8 are tucked into it. Classic and
   new-style apps run efficiently on the OS.
   Smartphones would have a different UI from the one available on the
   featured image; the software giant has been lip-sealed on the
   development however. But it concludes by saying it would a massive
   update over Windows Phone 8.1.
   Getting Spicy
   From today, a technical preview version of Windows 10 would be
   available to users for testing purpose. If you want to try your hands
   on the pre-release copy, you can “download the Windows 10 preview part
   of a new Windows Insider program,” said Myerson.
   Like earlier reported, Windows 10 will work efficiently in an array of
   devices and Joe Belfiore, VP of Windows had some demonstration to keep
   consumers at the edge. Whether it’s the old-school command prompt,
   Windows 7-style task bar or modern touch screens, Windows 10 answers
   all.
   Windows 8 suffered a backlash from consumers and analysts globally, and
   Microsoft has had several update to fix the issues raised. But it has
   never given what consumers actually wanted. Windows 10 will shake
   things up, completely bringing to light and even more than what
   consumers can think off.
   Gone are the days when company’s think they know what’s good for users,
   it is the users that determine the fate of a product and it is evident
   that Apple saw astronomical results, after listening to users for the
   first time, where it released the iPhone 6 with a bigger display.

[74]U.S. Records First Case Of Ebola

   2:43 pm  Markson Gboru  [75]No comments

   The CDC just confirmed the first case of Ebola in the United States,
   according to Reuters. The patient was placed in "strict isolation" at
   Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas earlier today.
   A patient in a Dallas hospital has been confirmed to have the Ebola
   virus, News 8 has learned.
   In a statement issued Tuesday night, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital
   Dallas said the patient was admitted based on symptoms and "recent
   travel history."
   The hospital, located at Greenville Avenue and Walnut Hill Lane in
   northeast Dallas, said it's complying with all recommendations from the
   Centers for Disease Control and the Texas Department of Health to
   ensure the safety of other patients and medical staff.
   A press conference to discuss the case is scheduled for 5:30 pm.
   At least 3,091 people have died from Ebola since the West African
   outbreak was first identified in Guinea six months ago. Last week, the
   CDC warned that between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa
   could be infected with Ebola by January 2015.
   News of the virus' appearance sent the share prices of key
   biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies skyrocketing in after-hours
   trading, in anticipation that large drug companies may benefit from
   creating a vaccine. BioCryst Pharma shot up 15 percent in after-market
   trading, while Tekmira soared by nearly 17 percent.

[79]Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Operating System

   1:47 pm  Markson Gboru  [80]No comments

   At its Windows event in San Francisco today, Microsoft announced the
   next release of its operating system. Known until now as codename
   Threshold, the successor to Windows 8 will officially be known as
   Windows 10.
   Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Operating
   System, unveiled the name, after saying Windows is used by about 1.5
   billion people. “Windows is at a Threshold and now it’s time for a new
   Windows,” Myerson said at the event. “It wouldn’t be right to call it
   Windows 9.”
   Before giving the new name, Myerson trolled everyone by saying it would
   be called Windows One. Since Windows 1 has already been released
   though, the company chose to go with Windows 10. He did promise,
   however, that Windows 10 would work across all types of devices
   (computers, tablets, phones, and of course the Internet of Things):
   “One product family. One platform. One store.”
   The new operating system will offer a tailored experience for each
   device, but a single store will offer apps and updates across all
   devices. Windows 10 “will deliver the right experience on the right
   device at the right time,” Myerson said.
   As the company has said before, it’s bringing back the Start menu. At
   its Build 2014 conference in April, Microsoft had a mockup available.
   Today, it has the real deal, at least as it stands right now (remember,
   a lot can change from today):
   The Start menu not only has live tiles, but you can resize them, which
   impacts the overall size of the menu itself. You can also search the
   Web and receive results without opening up a browser.
   While showing off the new operating system, Joe Belfiore, Corporate
   Vice President, Operating Systems Group at Microsoft, said today that
   going from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is like going from a Prius to a
   Tesla. “They don’t have to learn any new way to drive.”
   Windows 10 will naturally support universal Windows apps. As has been
   rumored before, they will be accessible from the desktop in a windowed
   mode. The Snap View will also work with both classic and universal
   apps.
   [81][blogger-image--431269167.jpg]
   Belfiore also demoed new features like Task View (which shows you all
   the apps that are currently open, even across virtual desktops):
   Despite the focus on the mice and keyboard today, Microsoft will keep
   the touch part of Windows 8 around. The argument here is that touch
   users have higher satisfaction on Windows 8 devices than on Windows 7
   devices. The opposite is true for mouse and keyboard users. As a
   result, Microsoft wants businesses to think of Windows 10 as a merging
   of Windows 7 and Windows 8.
   Here is the Windows 10 Start Screen:
   The preview we’re seeing today isn’t completely new. Screenshots and
   videos have been leaking for weeks, showing off the new Start menu, the
   virtual desktops feature, the Notification Center, a flatter user
   interface, and even Cortana integration.
   This release is also expected to be different in that Microsoft is
   hoping to gather more feedback than usual. Many of the features and
   changes aren’t even ready to show off yet, so testers can expect the
   company will be constantly tweaking its offering over the next months.
   It’s important to emphasize that today’s event is the first of many to
   come. While this one focuses on enterprise and power users, Microsoft
   will naturally host others, including ones for consumers. In fact,
   early next year the company will talk “more about the consumer story”
   and during its Build conference in April 2015, it will “share more
   about Universal apps.”
   The reason business users are getting a nod from Microsoft first is
   simple: that’s where the company makes the big bucks. “One of the most
   important customers for Windows is the enterprise,” Myerson said at the
   event. Redmond is very interested in communicating that it has been
   hard at work to move away from Windows 8, which many have criticized
   for not being as easy to use with a mouse and keyboard.
   The next version of Windows was widely expected to arrive sometime next
   year. Even the Wi-Fi password at the event was chosen to remind
   everyone of this: “ Windows2015.”

[84]Worlds Thinnest SmartPhone?

   9:56 am  Markson Gboru  [85]No comments

   The world’s thinnest phone, as certified by the Guinness Book of
   Records, is now on sale in the United States. It’s called the Blu Vivo
   IV and, at 5.5 millimeters, it’s considerably more svelte than the
   6.9-millimeter iPhone 6 and the newly released 6.7-millimeter Samsung
   Galaxy Alpha.
   Blue Vivo IV
   It also has a 5-inch, 1080 pixel by 1920 pixel Super AMOLED display,
   and a 1.7 GHz octa-core processor. All of that comes for $299 without
   the need to sign a contract. Sound too good be true? Well, it does have
   a few drawbacks. First, forget 4G LTE coverage; this is strictly a 3G
   phone. It also lacks the latest version of Android, coming with Android
   4.2 Jelly Bean instead of 4.4 KitKat, and only comes with 16 GB of
   storage. It’s not the world’s most powerful phone and its camera won’t
   win any awards. Still, at $299 ( ₦49,000 approximately)

[88]Nokia HERE Maps APK Forandroid Leaks

   9:51 am  Markson Gboru  [89]No comments

   I was waiting for this:
   Nokia had previously announced its plans to release a version of HERE
   Maps for Android, but only for Samsung devices for now. Although the
   app is yet to officially release, somebody managed to get their hands
   on the APK and unsurprisingly, it works on any Android device running
   4.0 and above.
      Nokia HERE Maps is a fully featured navigation utility, and has all
   the features, including turn
   by turn voice navigation. It also has something unique, where you can
   download maps for entire cities, which can then be used offline or in
   areas with no network.
        The APK is still in beta so might have some
   bugs but if it’s worth a try.

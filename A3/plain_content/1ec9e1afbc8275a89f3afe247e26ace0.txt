[3]Poorly Chaise

   Hey everyone, since i'm suffering at home with my poorly face I thought
   why not blog about it... Unfortunately last night around 6pm I fainted
   it couldn't be worked out why but sadly I did... then an again i
   fainted not long after :( And now I shall be in pain and sleepy for a
   couple of weeks :( :( dubble sad face. Silly me managed to land and
   fall badly and hurt my face. I'ts made me sad because I can't go to
   college and act today and I really wanted to because I have already had
   a two week half term so I miss it lots.

   Also I just wanted to remind you guys that a new YouTube video will be
   up shortly as it is already record from before I had a poorly head
   witch was fortunate because head hurts too much to make one.
   While I can remember is it just me who's looking forward to some nice
   pancakes tomorrow. There either has to be lemon juice and sugar on or
   melted chocolate/chocolate sauce then it's just perfection. how do you
   like your pancakes? also don't for get to subscribe to me

[25]Archie Does My Makeup Video

   As some of you may have seen I have a new video up. YAY!!!! It's with
   one of my friends Archie as you have probably guessed by the title :) I
   met him last summer at StageCoach a stage school I got to for three
   hours of a Friday. I let him attack my face with some makeup the
   results were... interesting!

                          [26][20140301_131129.jpg]
                                 Archie and I

   It was an amazingly fun video to make mainly because his a guy that's
   so clueless with makeup so what can you expect?

                          [27][20140301_115651.jpg]

[45]Update

   Hey, I just thought I would give you all a update of what is going on
   lately in my life and for my YouTube. So I guess i'll start with what
   I've been up to. Yesterday I went to see a show at the New Alexandra
   Theatre it was called 'Tonight's The Night'  it was fantastic and the
   singing was awesome!! I really think it's worth checking out if your in
   the Birmingham area so if you want to know more check out this link
   :) [46]TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. At the moment i'm on my second week of my
   half term and i'm actually looking forward to going back to BOA because
   I've missed acting so much. I have also added some cute decorations to
   my room to make it much more exciting for me. I really like when
   bedrooms have words on the wall I think it's really cool and looks
   amazing, here's a link to the picky on instergram of it
   ... [47]http://instagram.com/p/krwDR5EkKd/

     So my current YouTube plans are i'm hoping to film with a friend
     some fun makeup stuff  for my channel and some hair stuff on there
     channel and I can already tell it will be hilarious and i'm looking
     forward to doing some videos with more than just me in because I
     think that will be cool and I look forward to working with a friend
     who is also on YouTube that you will meet in the video, so that
     should be super exciting!!! I am also planning to do some YouTube
     tag's soon so you can all get to know me better as I am just
     starting out. But if there is anything you want to see, like always
     let me know :D See you soon on YouTube :D but until then you can
     find me like this....

[65]The New Video

   So as some of you may know I uploaded my YouTube video 'Angry Chaise'
   yesterday :) I'm excited to be getting back in to YouTube and look
   forward to making more video's to share. So far it has been a huge
   success, the views have been going down well and i've even gained more
   subscribers from it!!! :D a extra 7 I think. So I am overjoyed by that.
   If you haven't watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? :P
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNXz7z2kNQ0
   make sure to hit that beautiful subscribe button when you do it to. :)
   'Angry Chaise' shows some of the littler things that bug me just a bit.
   Like the whole Lauren Goodger puddle situation, as well as totally
   relatable instergram pet peeves. So how about you share with me what
   annoys you and we can moan together :)
   So I have some ideas for the next few videos I am going to do but if
   there is anything you think I should do or you would like to see let me
   know and I will get on it soon as :) Until then I am having a good two
   weeks off I had another driving lesson yesterday and I think i'm
   getting confident at it and surprised how easy it is coming. I have my
   next lesson Wednesday at 11 so I am excited for that. Well i'll talk to
   you in my next YouTube video or blog post but till then I hope everyone
   is okay but I best go get my nuggets out the oven i'd hate for them to
   burn. Later xx

[74]The little BIG start up!

   This is my first post to my blog and yup-ady-do my first blog EVER and
   all I can think is that I am supper excited for all the possibility's.
   I used to love creating amazing creative PICZO websites when I was
   little and I got really good at it, it kinda became my thing. I'd come
   back from primary school sit at the computer for hours and hours till I
   went to bed making my website cool (friends even got me to make there
   website cooler) so internet things like blogs, websites and YouTube
   have always seemed like a interesting to me and something generally
   cool.To but it in it's simply I like the whole fun YouTube and blogging
   community and I thinks it looks cool  and I want in !!!! :P
   I guess the best way to start is a introduction to me. Lets cover the
   basics AYH? My name is Chaise Louise Newman. This is my face :)
   [75][250761_4991855085857_1776613702_n.jpg]
   I used to really hate my name being Chaise when I was little because I
   could never get my names on novelty stuff. Funny story about that
   actually... When I was little lots of people were getting little
   sticker books and each sticker had there name on. I managed to find one
   of the stick books online...
   [76][stace.JPG]
   As you can see they were so cute and I was peanut butter and jelly over
   them and supper sad they didn't have Chaise ones. With help from my
   mommy I set out pen in hand with my best hand writing in mind wrote a
   lovely letter to the creator saying lots about how I really loved the
   stickers all my friends had but just wished they would make ones with
   my name. To my mom's surprise and my childish delight the lady hand
   wrote me a lovely letter back with a free book of ... YOU GUESSED IT
   Chaise stickers :) Imagine my excitement! So I guess I was that cool
   kid that with my berol hand writing pen wrote letter to people about
   things they cared about. But now, I LOVE MY NAME. I like that I don't
   know anyone with it because it makes me special :) Also I don't have
   the issue of someone shouting my name in a crowd and 5 people all turn
   round. It's different, It's unique. It's ME and it sure made getting
   Equity a piece of cake.
   Another cool fact about me is someday I will be one of the best
   actresses the world has ever seen!! I love acting, I always have! I
   started it when I was 8 and never looked back. There is something fun
   in playing a character because you get to be lots of different people
   and see how that feels. I learn acting (btec level 3 performing arts
   acting) at the best place to in brum, (thats Birmingham, England) and
   it makes me so happy to turn up to sixth form there each day because I
   like being round creative people and I do what I love in an environment
   were anything goes and everyone free to be what ever they want to be.
   Thank you for taking minutes out of your day to learn about me, it
   means alot!
   Have questions about me? Want to know more? JUST ASK :) I'd love to
   hear from anyone

   Anonymous asked: "hello! can i ask for a tutorail in hands/arms and
   legs/feet?"

   [34]zemael:

     Hey! Sorry for the late reply, I haven’t really had time to do the
     tutorial for you! But, I did one today. It’s kinda messy and not
     100% anatomically perfect (I do several flaws myself) but I think I
     made some good points!
     * Arms:

     image

     Arms cannot be done without shoulders, so that’s why I will include
     them here. To know how one body part works, you need to understand
     the other parts too. I suggest drawing a stick figure, as shown
     above. Do it with shoulders and everything - don’t care about
     anatomy. Really, don’t - go mad! You can figure out how to deal with
     the anatomy AFTER you have figured how to draw the body freely.

     image

     I imagine most body parts to be shaped as tear drops, as shown
     above; especially the arms and legs. Draw them above the stick
     figure - don’t be afraid to overlap the teardrops. In fact, I
     suggest it! The best way to understand anatomy is to think of it as
     shapes and doll-parts.

     image

     After you’ve figured that out, do several, VERY tiny, small doodles
     like these. Go crazy - don’t bother with anatomy just yet. Do them
     also very quickly and so small you can’t think of the details. Just
     keep doing this until you sorta understand how arms work.

     image

     Here is a doodle of a “real” arm, and as you can see, how it’s
     shaped it resembles the teardrops above. A general rule is to
     constantly draw the body in curves - male AND female. NEVER draw a
     single line straight.

     image

     I mentioned before I thought it was important to include
     shoulders/other body parts to understand another. This is why. The
     body basically has a “flow” when you move. The red lines clearly
     shows the flow. This is also how you can create a dynamic pose:
     think of the flow. The muscles are formed that way to be able to
     function. Which reminds me, buy some good anatomy books. And I’m
     talking about more or less MEDICAL anatomy books - you think you
     won’t need it - but trust me, it’s more useful than you can imagine.
     I do NOT suggest buying “stylistic” anatomy books, like Christopher
     Hart (ugh NO), for example, as these can mislead you. Medical
     anatomy books CANNOT because they MUST be right.

     image

     And for the last part, here’s some “do’s” and “don’ts”. It’s
     important to remember the muscles between the neck and shoulders.
     Many, especially when drawing females, forget this. It’s true the
     most visible it is - the more muscular you will look. But even the
     most petite people have these. Your neck literally would not
     function if you didn’t have these supporters. Then, the arms below
     is just to show why it’s important to draw the body with curves.
     Many have probably heard “straight lines for males” which is a
     complete lie. They will look stiff and unnatural. Curves can both
     empathize muscles AND fat. Heck, even your bones aren’t straight.
     * Legs:

     image

     Legs certainly are the hardest. There’s a good reason for this;
     because they’re one of our most strongest muscles, and they are more
     or less dominating when it comes to poses (together with the spine).
     However, just like with the arms, draw a stick figure. I won’t
     suggest drawing them completely straight, as you can see here, as it
     will add weight. Do teardrops shapes. As for the hips - think of
     them as panties or briefs. This is not a MUST; but it will help; I
     think!

     image

     And just like the arms, do small doodles. Don’t be serious, play
     around until you get the idea.

     image

     image

     As you can see, these legs easily can be turned into teardrops even
     when they’re detailed like this.

     image

     Now, what makes legs/hips interesting is that the way fat gathers
     there. Although not a must, seeing as we’re all different, females
     tend to get more fat there than men. Usually, however, it’s not at
     the SIDE of the hops, but at the thighs, calves and the “love
     handles”. (Excuse my english, aaah…) Women also tend to have bigger
     hips, but again, it’s not a must. It’s not uncommon to have small
     hips, either; or big hips for men, etc.

     image

     image

     Of course, the legs too follow the “flow”!

     image

     Something worth noting is the “Standing point” The standing point is
     basically a straight line, and the further away you are from the
     line; the more unbalanced you are. To create a dynamic pose you
     should avoid that line as much as possible. However, if you want to
     look balanced/realistic, have the one leg stand there for support.
     The leg to the left is balanced, as you can see one of the legs is
     taking all the weight; with other words, it’s the support leg-making
     it balanced. The legs to the right, however, are likely to fall over
     if she keeps standing like that!

     image

     image

     Now for some more do’s and don’ts. I already mentioned the barbie
     legs, invisible heels and micro-mini crotch in my [35]previous
     tutorial, but these two are different. I see this mistake a lot;
     when you sit down, your thighs will become wider because you’re
     pressing all the fat to the sides. Now, this also depends on how
     you’re positioning your legs. How much it widens depends on how much
     fat you have in the first place; but it will always be there.

     And then there’s this awkward “thigh gap”. Before I get any haters
     telling me how I “thin shame”, please, take a seat and read
     [36]this. Good? Good. How much space you actually have between your
     thighs depends fully on how you’re standing, bending, angle, body
     type and everything else. However, the one to the right? Not likely.
     * Hands:

     image

     Okay, I’m getting really lazy now; so I’ll be quick. Draw a
     rectangle. Sorta like this; it doesn’t have to be exactly like this
     - since hands can be shaped VERY differently. Just compare to your
     friends.

     image

     Draw a little triangle attached to it.

     image

     Now, the fingers! How long they should be and etc doesn’t really
     matter either. But if you’re unsure, draw them as tear drops, too.

     image

     Now, draw the fingers! Starting to look like a hand, sort of.

     image

     Then draw the details and fix things you didn’t like. I really don’t
     like the way this is drawn but I’m just tired right now.

     image

     Just like the legs/arms, practice by doing that simple figure really
     quickly.

     image

     Guess what? Hands also follow “the flow”!
     * Feet:

     image

     image

     Okay, I’m getting really lazy. Plus, feet are SUPER HARD- I’m just
     going to say this: think of them as triangles. Overlap them; think
     of it as 3D!

     image

     image

     image

     Practice practice practice! And medical anatomy books. And photo
     references. And real-life references!

     Hope this helped! \o/ As I said, I’m nowhere near perfect but, ahh,
     I tried.

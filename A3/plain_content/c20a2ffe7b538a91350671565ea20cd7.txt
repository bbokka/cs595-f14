[9]iPhone 6 Review: A Short Story

   [10]Leave a reply

   Samantha got the iPhone 6 early, taking it out of the box made her feel
   guilty. She felt that it was a mistake to have received it so early,
   and considered not even opening it. She opened it anyway. She pretended
   she wasn’t opening it at all. She pretended the box had crawled into
   her arms like a cat and opened itself. She repeated a mantra she read
   in Metaphysics Weekly: “Gratitude is receivership.”

   Inside the box was the iPhone 6, and though she had accustomed herself
   to a flip phone she knew she had to upgrade. The people at the Apple
   Store got mad at her for having this phone. She would bring it in to
   have them fix it, claiming it was the iPhone 8 and she was a time
   traveler. She wrote a paper on this for college and got a C. She
   started telling friends it was performance art. The phone, the paper,
   the sense of humiliation at her grade. It was elaborate performance
   art. Her life was a performance art. Her friends started to think she
   was crazy. She told her new friends that was her plan all along.

   The iPhone 6 required a minor upgrade to her brain. She had to mentally
   download Adobe Brain 8. She delayed the upgrade for as long as
   possible, feeling okay with having a normal human brain, but the pop up
   messages had become increasingly hostile. They said “Are you sure you
   don’t want to upgrade? You’re really stupid.” Samantha tried to sue
   Adobe. Adobe claimed the upgrade prompt was performance art. The judge
   had a TV show where he said his catchphrase: “Don’t tell me it’s
   snowing when I got a weather app.” Samantha was shocked when he said it
   in person. Real life is a TV show. It is serialized and full of
   commercials for Old Spice. Real life is a soap opera. People have
   affairs with nurses. Samantha wanted to be a nurse. She felt like a
   side character in a bad TV show.

   Once Samantha upgraded her brain she was astonished that there were no
   ads playing in her brain. She had, however, signed up her email address
   and they would send her ads like “You’ll never BELIEVE what this 8 year
   old can do.” She watched the video. He just sang and Elvis song. Life
   was an overplayed Elvis song. It was Hound Dog on repeat.

   Using the iPhone 6 was strange. The iPhone 6 often didn’t text the
   correct people. Samantha wanted to text her ex a picture of a cat with
   a sombrero. The iPhone 6 told her, politely, that Samantha was
   sublimating a desire for love. Samantha acted aggressively, saying the
   iPhone 6 was judgmental. The iPhone 6 apologized but became passive
   aggressive. It sent texts to Samantha’s mom that Samantha was binge
   drinking. It took videos of her stubbing her toe. It recorded her
   singing in the shower. Samantha tried to confront the iPhone 6. The
   iPhone 6 said it was performance art. Life was performance art.
   Samantha made tea and told the iPhone 6 nothing was wrong. Like a bad
   relationship, her new iPhone experience had gone from elation, to
   confusion, to the slow realization that this new acquired thing was not
   what she was looking for. It was just another crappy thing to maintain,
   to leave at home on Friday and complain about with her friends.

   Samantha returned the iPhone 6 and tried to trade it in for a mail
   carrying pigeon. The people at the Apple Store said this would require
   paper work. Life was paper work. Life was blank slots with “first name”
   and a line that you had to fill in. “Samantha” Samantha wrote.
   Occupation: “Performance Artist.” She left the Apple Store, she
   attached a note to a carrier pigeon. “Gratitude.”

[23]2015- A Retrospective

   [24]Leave a reply

   In 2015, people were stupid. They progressed towards being stupid,
   exponentially, first starting with forgetting to do little things like
   clean their rooms, and then, suddenly, with big things like eating
   three meals a day and sleeping 8 hours. People became happier, quick to
   give money to beggars on the street. The pop charts that year were
   littered with songs about feeling good. Music, often discordant and
   aggressive, had become mellow. The Beach Boys were in. Nirvana was not.


   2015 came with the changing of the calendar, but was marked ostensibly
   by the president retiring. He had decided to spend more time with his
   family. People were forgetful; they kept forgetting to elect a new
   president. Foreign policy became something on an obscure to-do-list.
   Other countries forgot to keep in contact, as if the world was a parent
   they had not called on its birthday. Diplomacy was easy. The world was
   “very chill.”


   Samantha sat in her room with a Monster energy drink. She had bought
   the one without calories because she was afraid to gain weight. She
   stared at her stomach in the mirror, feeling it was out of her control.
   Her weight was an unruly child. Her body was doing things she did not
   understand; it wasn’t receptive to her parenting. It colored on the
   walls. It spilled orange juice on her college diploma.


   Samantha and her roommate cooked breakfast one morning. Her roommate
   had a guy over, someone Samantha kept forgetting to save in her
   long-term memory. He was less than a boyfriend, but had been here
   enough times that Samantha felt obligated to know his name. She thought
   up random names to see if they would fit. “Mark. John. Chris. Matt.
   Ronald. George. Aziz.” She liked Aziz the best. She said “Aziz” while
   cooking eggs. Her roommate said “Aziz?”


   “I read in the paper that Obama’s favorite movie is Casablanca,” the
   boy said.

   “I read in the paper that the newspaper is lying,” Samantha’s roommate
   said. “They are tired of printing facts. The newspapers are into
   fiction now.”

   “Casablanca is so banal,” Samantha said, “he should have picked an
   obscure movie. Something with aliens and Albert Camus.”


   Samantha overcooked her eggs. She had long since taken to eating her
   eggs however they came out. She accepted them as an extension of her
   own life. The same force that had given birth to her, had given her her
   first love, had allowed her to write for an underground newspaper
   called The Paper Paper had been involved in her cooking. If she said no
   to it, now, what else would fall apart? Samantha felt holy while eating
   her eggs. She said a prayer that she invented. It was religious only to
   herself. She said “trust the process.”


   “I read in the paper that Napoleon was actually very tall. He was
   practically a giant. He drank 3 bottles of wine with dinner.”
   Samantha’s roommate said.

   “I think that was a misprint,” the boy said, “I read it was 13 bottles
   of wine.”


   Samantha drove to the nearest Starbucks and ordered an iced-coffee. She
   told the woman at the counter her name was “Agatha.” The barista
   trusted her. This was how people were in 2015. They trusted anything
   you said. If they found out you lied they just said “okay.” People were
   tired of being lied too, but they were more tired of having to analyze
   and judge. The human brain was a cul-de-sac of sentience. It had gone
   back to something innocent. It was ready to accept contradictions and
   nonsense. Teachers gave all A’s. How could they judge something that
   someone else had said? After all, it was a fact. The person had said
   it. And why not? Why not say something. Say anything. Say everything.
   People said things and laughed. Everyone was really funny that year.
   People said things like “My mother makes mongoose juice.”


   “Why did your parents name you Agatha?” the barista asked.

   “It sounded cool,” Samantha said.

   “It sounds like something,” the barista said.

   “Flagatha,” Samantha said.

   “Okay,” the barista smiled.


   In 2015 the antidepressant manufactures went out of business. The
   people who made Zoloft and Paxil started making paper hats for
   children’s birthday parties. This, to them, was hilarious. They felt
   more creative than ever. They put funny sayings on them. They wrote
   things like “You are old!” and “Time is funny, honey.” They felt great
   about this. They had a better time than mixing chemicals in a
   laboratory. The trend caught on. Everybody ordered hats and felt good
   about it. The economy was booming.


   Samantha said grace for her iced-coffee. She mixed sugar in with
   seriousness only reserved for ritual. She said “thank you for
   existence,” then added, “trust the process.”


   Samantha had once loved someone who was a stranger. They had met on the
   Internet. In 2015 this is how people often met. They googled other
   people. They downloaded PDFs with their lover’s innermost feelings.
   They highlighted parts that made them laugh, or cry. They sent it back
   in a zipped folder. They made the folders only available by a password
   that would make sense to the person who had made the PDF. Some said:
   “August 5^th,” others said “funny kitten.”


   Samantha and her lover were obsessed with hummus. They tried all the
   different types of hummus, and it became the kind of thing other’s
   noticed. People would see them driving around and mouth “hummus?”
   Samantha would nod, but roll down the window. “Hummus” she would say.
   They would laugh.


   Her lover painted pictures of Andy Warhol. He couldn’t paint Andy’s
   face correctly. One looked suspiciously like John Wayne. Another looked
   like Samantha.


   “Why did you draw me as Andy Warhol,” Samantha interrupted.

   “No,” her lover said, “it’s the opposite way around.”


   In 2013 Samantha was not ready to love another person. But times were
   different then. People fell in love and were happy for a period of time
   in which they projected movies, books and music onto each other. They
   send audio files of songs by Joni Mitchell. They stalked their lover’s
   Facebook in order to divine obscure secrets in tagged pictures from
   2009. What did their lover’s shirts say? The Beatles? Maybe it said
   Beats. Maybe their lovers had beat farms. Maybe it was bears. Maybe
   their lovers were bears in costumes.


   In time people’s lovers became ex-lovers. They found small problems and
   diagnosed large illnesses. They recommended therapy, counseling,
   Lexapro, electroshock therapy, Buddhism, poetry and Kierkgaard. Lovers
   became weary of listening to each other. They didn’t want to interpret
   the Upanishads. They didn’t want to pick up prescriptions at CVS. They
   wanted to make love and eat hummus. Love, it turns out, wasn’t hummus.
   It wasn’t even close to hummus. If you had all the hummus in the world,
   and attacked it with a giant spoon it would do nothing. People wanted
   to want nothing from each other. People wanted to watch people, like
   movies. People wanted to change their profile pics. People wanted to
   instagram skyscrapers. People wanted to do nothing.


   But in 2015, people renounced this. People were happy with another
   person whether or not they texted back immediately. Perhaps, they
   thought, the person’s brain was different. Perhaps, they thought,
   silence was a way to say I love you.


   Samantha made iced-tea in her bedroom. She listened to her roommate and
   her roommate’s something talk about Nirvana.


   “Why did he kill himself? Her roommate said.

   “Because” her roommate said, “because the reason anything happens.”

   “Which is?” she said.

   “Um, the thing. The big thing.”

   “What is the big thing?”

   “Not sure,” he said, “do you watch Seinfeld?”

   “Sometimes,” she said.


   Samantha fell asleep for four months. She woke up after dreaming she
   was married to Napoleon. He bought her a necklace made of fuzzy
   triangles.


   When she woke up it was 2014. She felt confused. This was what life
   will do. This was it.

   Rocket finished eating his Ramen Noodles. He searched the floor and
   found that one noodle had fallen from his Styrofoam cup. He placed it
   into his garbage can, next to a can of Redbull and thought “it gives
   you wings.”

   He briefly considered whether or not this was garbage or recycling, and
   remembered a conversation he had four nights ago while drunk with his
   ex-girlfriend Tamara about being ecologically friendly. “Fuck the
   world,” he thought, throwing it in the trash. He opened up his text
   message drafts and drafted “fuck the world,” adding it to a long text
   message he almost sent to Tamara saying he read Being and Nothingness
   and was scared to die alone. He felt stupid that this was all he got
   out of it. He felt like he’d never understand anything without relating
   it to his emotional life. He felt a strong feeling of dread without any
   reason.

   Rocket screenshotted a text from Gamora about a band she hated. She
   wrote to him “they sound like they want to be happier than they are.”
   He posted it on twitter while browsing his internet history of
   pornography. He looked at four vides he watched yesterday, feeling
   clinical and judging them on a 1-10 scale of hotness and
   re-watchability. Gamora texted him a screenshot of his twitter post and
   said “meta-screenshot.” Rocket texted her “I love you. No, just
   kidding, I love KFC.”

   Rocket drove his car around the unfamiliar area of Long Island for
   thirty-five minutes. A song came on the radio and he struggled to turn
   it up while wondering whether or not he would die. Would he die for
   this song? He thought no, but continued to try and turn it up. Rocket
   felt ready to crash his car, he felt invincible towards the world. He
   turned the song up really loud and sang to it like they would in a
   movie. “I’m so fancy. . . .” he hummed.

   Rocket went out to Knowhere Bar and ordered a plate of hummus while he
   sipped a Jack-and-Coke and waited for Tamara to get there. The
   bartender asked him where he was from. “Ummm, New Jersey” he said.
   “Cool, my friend lives in Camden,” the bartender said. “Umm, Camden is
   okay,” Rocket said.

   Tamara showed up and sat next to him, accidentally dropping her purse
   onto the ground.

   “I’m clumsy,” she said, laughing.

   “I’m clumsier,” Rocket said, “I’m a raccoon.”

   “I forgot that,” she said, “sometimes I forget you’re a raccoon.”

   “Only on my mom’s side,” Rocket said.

   “What else are you?” Tamara asked.

   “I think . .. German?” Rocket said.

   Tamara played three songs from the jukebox that Rocket had never heard.
   She said they were new songs that were going to be popular soon.

   “ I know about the Billboard charts,” Tamara said, “I like to keep
   track of them.”

   “You should work for Billboard,” Rocket said.

   “Okay,” she said.

   “You will?” he asked.

   “Yes,” she said, “I said okay.”

   Rocket remembered him and Tamara in Washington Square Park two autumns
   ago and felt nostalgia. He remembered that she said she hated shrimp
   and he asked her why. She kept saying she didn’t know. Rocket told her
   he was going to get her shrimp for her birthday. Tamara said not to.
   Rocket said he was going to buy her shrimp by the dozen. Tamara said
   she’d hate him forever. Rocket felt close to her, knowing she would
   never do that.

   Tamara got drunk and puked on the way to Rocket’s apartment.

   “Boot and rally,” she said, then smiled weakly.

   “I don’t know what that means,” Rocket said.

   “If you have to ask, you’ll never know,” Tamara said.

   Rocket couldn’t think of anything witty to say. He put his hands into
   his hoodie. He found a receipt from 7/11. He wanted to buy all the
   7/11’s in the world. He wanted to be the 7/11 manager for all the
   stores, and say “not on my shift.”

   Tamara slept over and left in the morning without saying anything.
   Rocket rolled over in bed and checked his text messages. Gamora sent
   him a link to a new band. He texted Gamora to ask if she was doing
   anything. Gamora said she was going to finish some homework. Rocket
   said okay.

   Rocket made tea and curled up into bed. He didn’t want to get out of
   bed today. He didn’t think it would be possible to get out of bed
   anymore. He closed his eyes and imagined a totally different universe.
   He imagined that the universe he was in was only temporary. There was
   going to be a better one coming soon. Coming Soon, like a movie
   trailer. His life was just a trailer for this movie. He fell asleep.

[56]How To Be a Person

   [57]Leave a reply

   How To Be a Person
    1. Say things to other people. This is your basic step. This is like
       breathing. This is when you become someone. You will be defined by
       this step. Anything you say will be confusing, it will inevitably
       confuse thousands of people. It will inspire people to talk about
       you and/or blog about you. This is your big moment.
    2. Do things to other people. Example: Your lover is leaving for a
       foreign country. You show up to dinner. You say you bought a cheap
       bottle of wine. Fight about what is champagne. You want to say
       something. You want to say something like “sorry I don’t know
       champagne.” Instead, gently touch his/her hand when they are about
       to pay the check. Pay the check. Smile, weakly. Keep smiling until
       they leave.
    3. Have feelings. Say things like “I am scared to exist in New
       Jersey.” Feel the weight of yourself in New Jersey. Look at the
       sunset, and for a second feel cliché’. Fight the feeling. Now,
       you’re just looking at it. You text your friend about what they’re
       doing later. Think of the future. It’s cool when the sun sets. Feel
       what it’s like to be alive.
    4. Have desires. Want something foreign and strange. Want someone to
       know your favorite music album. Want someone to understand the
       profundity of a music album. Want to listen to music. Want to know
       what the song is about. Google it. It’s exactly what you thought it
       was about. Want to share this. Share this on your blog. Share this
       feeling. Want to be understood. Want to be here.
    5. Fuck up. Ruin something that was a good thing. Feel bad about it.
       Tell your friends things like “I fucked up.” Eat doritos with
       strangers while hoping they ask you about something fucked up. Feel
       the weight of the chip in your hand, and hold it silently, like
       it’ll solve everything.
    6. Succeed at something. Unexpectedly, collide with the thing you
       wanted to do or have. Feel disbelief. Wonder if you are dreaming.
       Question reality. Feel powerful and dissociated. Feel high, but
       distrustful of this. Text someone while extending your other hand.
       Drink coffee and feel okay.
    7. Love someone. Understand songs on the radio. Feel “normal” because
       you understand things like getting up in the morning. Brush your
       teeth like a ritual. Shower like a ritual. Everything you do seems
       to be guided by an invisible hand. Tell people things about your
       day. Go into inane details about things to your friends. Say you’re
       cautious. Say you’re being insane. Secretly, feel something inside
       of you shift.

[61]The Miserable People Are Going to Mars

   [62]Leave a reply

   The Miserable People are starting a space program. The Miserable People
   Space Program has a goal that is to get off of earth. “Earth is so
   1990,” they say in their mission statement on tumblr, “we’re over it.”

   The Miserable People are raising money- they had a kickstarter that
   didn’t quite make the goal. They offered things like “our eternal
   gratitutde” and “undying love, the movie kind.” But people do not want
   things like “undying love,” people want T-shirts that will shrink in
   the wash. The Miserable People did bake sales, because people’s wives
   “are awesome at baking” and don’t want to hurt their feelings. The
   Miserable People felt bad when nobody bought their apple pies. They
   made good excuses to why nobody bought it- even though they knew it
   wasn’t because it was raining that day.

   The Miserable People are going to go to Mars, and they’re going to
   start new societies that don’t care if you do things that don’t hurt
   other people. The Miserable People have been hurt so much that they’re
   always apologizing for things they haven’t done yet. They’re hoping to
   start new lives- ones where they are kinder and smarter and go to their
   friends art shows so they won’t be considered “flakes.” The Miserable
   People are downloading their favorite songs for the trip. The Miserable
   People are downloading the entire discography of The Beatles and
   smiling, because they forgot how many songs The Beatles did that they
   really enjoyed.

   The Miserable People are “not spiritual or religious,” but they “want
   to love thy neighbor” and do other stuff that will make themselves and
   others a little bit happier. The Miserable People have spent so much of
   their lives as miserable people that they are ready for happiness.
   They’ve been preparing for it, like a test that will determine
   everything. It will change the laws of physics and gravity and time,
   and they will feel “like they’re high” on drugs they didn’t know
   existed.

   The Miserable People are almost ready to be happy people. The Miserable
   People are going to adopt all the puppies on television ads, because
   they’ve become conscious that living things are suffering even if they
   aren’t able to do things like text their friends about their “shitty
   day.” The Miserable People are blogging about the kinds of things they
   will do on Mars. The Miserable people are going to become healthy and
   eat organic and raw and try more kale. Shit loads of kale. So much kale
   because they’ve heard it’s so good and they want to be the type of
   person that will do things likes look up recipes. The Miserable People
   know that they’re going to love it. The Miserable People are sure this
   is going to be it. The Miserable People feel like they’re almost there-
   it’s so soon they almost want to cry because they can’t believe it.
   They’re hoping for a wealthy donor. Someone who has been waiting his or
   her entire life to donate to a project like this. Someone who got to
   the top of the corporate ladder only to realize he or she didn’t want
   that at all to begin with. The Miserable People know deep down they
   will look back on earth, and they will not understand what it was like
   to be miserable. And they will say, even in instances when they are
   sure nobody else is around, that they are okay.

[74]How to Finish a Novel, Parallel Park and be Wolverine in the Summer
of 2014

   [75]Leave a reply

   I stop the car outside my house.

   “Next time we’ll work on parallel parking,” she says. I think about how
   in the past few years I’ve lost the ability to parallel park. My
   cousin’s girlfriend says she didn’t forget how to drive after years of
   not doing it (like riding a bicycle, etc). But parking I seem to have
   forgotten. I think about how the brain prunes unused mental
   connections, and get to thinking about pruning connections perhaps
   related to bad tendencies (anxiety, depression, smoking.)

   I think about looking at porn but don’t do it, because I’ve been
   reading too many things that link to different things. There are so
   many tabs. I’ll be reading about Joan Didion, but then get side
   tracked. I wonder if thoughts are always sidetracked and tangential
   from other thoughts, or if they are the opposite and they all emerge
   from physiological feelings (I am tired, I am horny, I am emotionally
   engaged with this song).

   I imagine subjective universes where I’ve pruned bad habits. Neurons
   that “wire together fire together.” I imagine changing my name. I’ll
   dye my hair blonde. I’ll move to Ohio. I’ll manage a fast food
   restaurant and be the Zen-like manager that is always seemingly happy.
   Employees will like me. If you’re happy at work people like you. If you
   make small talk about the rain, you’ll be considered “friendly” and
   “affable,” but if you keep to yourself, if you don’t reveal things
   because you are “chronically depressed” or “in the closet” or “a serial
   killer” you will be disliked. Serial killers surprise their neighbors
   because they seemed “nice,” which is theoretically the best way to get
   away with being a serial killer. I think about nice people being serial
   killers (ex: my favorite waitress, my best friends, my crush). My crush
   doesn’t text me back. He is out serial killing.

   Yesterday I was at the beach. I was happy because I decided it was a
   “beach day” which is not a regular day. A regular day can’t be happy. A
   succession of “happy” days means they are just regular days. A person
   who seems happy is just regular. A person who seems happy is just a
   serial killer. My crush makes me happy, but one day will just make me
   feel regular. Heroin will make you happy, but then you will need it to
   just be normal. You’ll have to prune those neurons or become an addict.
   I cancel a driving lesson today. But I need to learn to park.

   The day before yesterday I made out with a stranger. I have no feelings
   about this person. He seems like he’s on drugs. The day before that I
   met someone who seemed like he was on drugs and he denied it. We
   discussed what constitutes an orgy. “More than four, four is a
   foursome, but a fivesome isn’t a thing.” “But if you went to an orgy
   and there were only five people you would be disappointed.” “But it
   would still be an orgy.” “It would be a small orgy.” One time I almost
   had a threesome, but didn’t. My ex got mad at me. I took a bath and
   imagined I was Hunter S. Thompson. I was in Atlantic City. Earlier we
   drank vodka and watched MTV. We shared songs that “reminded me of you”
   or “reminded me of this other song” or were “my friends band.” We were
   happy, but almost soon to be miserable. The happiness was a little
   layer of a miserable cake. We’d refer to the vacation as a reference
   point. Soon we will be miserable. I like guys who seem sad. My crush
   before now seemed sad. It was confirmed by a mutual friend. “He has
   problems,” my friend said. The sad ones are not serial killers. The sad
   ones are sensitive and heartbroken because life can be cruel. They are
   sad because they can’t stand the bad stuff in the world. The happy
   people are out serial killing. They are out making small talk. They are
   out parallel parking. They killed once and now it’s part of their
   programming. The sad people are trying to be happy. The sad people are
   learning to drive. The sad people are trying to become happy. They’re
   studying the art of being happy. When I can drive I’ll drive out to the
   beach. I’ll bring my crushes and my ex and have an orgy. But first I
   need to work on parallel parking.

   Everyone is seeing the new X-Men movie. I calculate how many times Hugh
   Jackman has played Wolverine. In my version of X-Men Wolverine can’t
   drive because of his claws. This gives him self esteem problems. He’s
   seventeen and all his friends are getting their licenses. They’re all
   going away to college, but he’s going to the X-men Academy. He’s on the
   waiting list for NYU but thinks he won’t get in. He feels discriminated
   against because he has metal for bones. He gets upset when his friends
   make fun of his weird anatomical differences. But he laughs along with
   them because to be sad would be to be too sensitive. Sensitive guys get
   made fun of more. He’s learned to be witty instead. Wolverine has the
   sassiest comebacks. At the X-men Academy he experiments with alcohol
   and drugs. He has one night stands with other mutants. His friends
   convince him to go to parties. “Do the claw thing” they say but he
   doesn’t want to be a parlor trick. “Do the claw thing” they say.
   Wolverine does it because it helps him fit in. In Junior year Wolverine
   worries about employment. In Senior year Wolverine has a bad break up.
   Wolverine’s girlfriend wants to have a threesome. Wolverine goes to the
   movies alone. He sees the new X-Men movie. He tries to sue whoever made
   it, but Bryan Singer has more money then he does. Wolverine has class
   anxiety. Wolverine is like me. Wolverine takes driving lessons.
   Wolverine is afraid of the future. The movie he saw has “Future” in the
   title and Wolverine feels anxious. Wolverine wants to prune the neurons
   that make him a Wolverine. He wants to quit smoking. Wolverine has a
   crush on someone. Wolverine is afraid to talk to others, lest he become
   a serial killer. Wolverine is afraid to parallel park.

   At a party I accidentally tell someone about my novel. I can’t stop
   telling people about my novel. “It’s like this other book,” I tell
   people, “but different.” Everything is like other things, but
   different. Everything is secretly part of the whole of existence, says
   Alan Watts. Alan Watts studied Budhism and eastern philosophy. I’m
   reading Schopenhauer and getting anxiety. I save the tab for later. My
   friend emails me about a new crush. “You’d get along” she says. My
   ex-boyfriend is on my Facebook feed. I feel anxiety. I’m trying to
   spend less money and I feel anxiety. I’m listening to hip hop and I
   feel less anxious, but then think about class and get anxiety. People
   post about the World Cup and I think about third world countries
   playing soccer and get anxiety about other nations with problems that
   are bigger than mine and I feel afraid for these other people.
   Wolverine feels O.K. about his left turns. If Wolverine focuses on
   things like his turn signal he won’t get so anxious.

   At a party I tell people about how I quit my job. At a party I’m asking
   if people are doing O.K. “Do you want water?” I ask people who seem
   like maybe they want water. One country beats another in the world cup.
   People are invested in the world cup. In The World Cup I pour water for
   anxious Wolverines who are scared to parallel park. Bret Easton Ellis’s
   novel starts “people are afraid to merge on highways,” or something. I
   compare my novel to his novel to people at parties, and people say
   they’ve seen the movie but haven’t read the book and I talk about
   oppression and sociology and existential stuff, but also spend time
   petting a dog. People are afraid of dogs, sometimes, if they’ve had a
   bad experience that was reinforced when they were young and now they’re
   forever afraid of dogs. This is how it is for anything. People are
   afraid of things. I read a story about how people become afraid of
   things. People are afraid to have orgies because they are too decadent,
   or too frightening or they’ve had bad experiences with sexual things.
   Society is afraid of people who are different, like gay people or
   Wolverines or people who are different races or classes. People want to
   get rid of different people, and people are scared to love others, or
   to be in love, or that they might not know what that even means.

   Wolverine is at a party. Wolverine wants to live, but is afraid of
   living because he might die. Wolverine is afraid to merge on highways.
   Wolverine has a crush on someone, but is afraid to be rejected.
   Wolverine drinks beer so he’ll feel less anxious about having claws, or
   not knowing what to say to someone he likes. Wolverine is writing a
   novel about people who don’t watch the World Cup, and how they might
   feel like the whole world is interested in something but he isn’t,
   because Wolverine has read Schopenhauer and now Wolverine is afraid of
   dogs, ones that might attack him and even though he has metal bones,
   he’s afraid the dogs will only want to chew on him like a chew toy.
   Wolverine is snapchatting his friends pics at the party. Wolverine is
   afraid people will judge him because of his driving. For this reason he
   tells people he’s a bad driver right off the bat. But people are afraid
   of bad drivers, and are afraid of crashing and afraid of being unhappy
   and afraid of dogs and afraid of Wolverine and Wolverine is afraid of
   things like not being loved, or not being texted by his crush or
   letting down his parents. Wolverine feels bad for existing. Wolverine
   does a dance with a girl, and then asks her about her hopes and dreams.
   She seems like a happy person, and somewhere in the third world people
   dream of being happy people and going to parties and parallel parking.

   In the Sims it’s 2014, and the Sims aren’t feeling guilty because in
   this version they don’t drive, they aren’t afraid to have crushes
   because they are being controlled by someone who controls all 8 people
   in the house, and this is you and you are God. All the Sims trust God.
   The Sims don’t know what anxiety is. The Sims can’t imagine anything.
   The Sims never have dreams.

   In Reality it’s 2014, and I’m on the highway and I’m trying to stay in
   one lane. If you stay in one lane you will be fine. If you don’t you
   might be afraid to crash. But I’m told to switch the lanes. I’m
   learning to park now. At some point, I will feel no fear of parking. I
   will be the first happy non serial killer. At some point, I will feel
   no fear of anything. At some point I will feel happy.

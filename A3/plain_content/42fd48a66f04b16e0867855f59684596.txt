[4]"Life is 10% what you experience, and 90% how you respond to it..."

   Ever experienced that moment where you open your mouth and nothing
   comes out? Not a murmur? Nada? Zip?
   Ever experienced that moment where you open your mouth and something
   comes out... but it's just not right? It's not what you wanted? It's
   not what you intended? It's not what you feel?
   No? You're lucky and I envy you, even if I struggle to 100% believe you
   in that answer.
   Yes? Then you might just understand where I'm coming from, at least
   partially if nothing else.
   See, it's these two ends of the spectrum where I've been living my life
   for the last couple of months now.
   (I'm not sure what this post is setting out to be yet; apology,
   emotional admission, deeply uninsightful warbling, who knows? But bear
   with me, as I know, if nothing else, it's important. Or it feels
   important to me. If you could just humour me, that'd be great.)
   I've written about past problems and battles (?) I've had with anxiety
   and panic, mental health. If you read it, thank you for taking the time
   to do so. If you didn't, but want to, [5]have at it (x). If you didn't,
   and don't want to, short version is; I'm a bit fucking weird (but if
   you've had any interaction with me whatsoever, you knew that anyway).
   I had problems, big deal, everyone does, just different ones. In some
   way. I suffered, got help, fixed myself. Sorted. Job done. However,
   what a great many of you don't know at this point (maybe you did, maybe
   you noticed, I don't know?) is a couple of months ago I started
   relapsing. The anxiety, the panic, the confusion, the instability. All
   starting to assert their presence, quite forcefully.
   Now, the situations are immeasurably different this time, compared to
   last. I'm working (I couldn't keep a job due to illness), I'm studying
   (I didn't even feel capable enough to contemplate it), I'm socialising
   (I shut myself off from everybody, physically), it's actually hard to
   keep me indoors now (I became agoraphobic).
   This means these things have been asserting themselves in different
   ways than before. See, mental health is a fluid concept. This means
   that mental health issues, illness, are also fluid.
   Hard to detect. Hard to confront. Hard.
   I'm happy. I think I'm happy. I should be happy.
   And yet, I knew. I could feel it. I don't know what 'it' is, but I knew
   it's face. It's claws, and that's not even dramatisation, they're
   definitely claws. It's eyes, that nobody else can see, staring out
   through mine, warping whatever comes into view.
   The common sense approach here is thus; you know you have a problem,
   you do something about it. Now any of you who know me, know that maybe
   commonsense isn't the first point I jump to (Ha!) always. For everyone
   else? Yes, of course. Myself, well that's far less straight forward.
   Less important.
   (Okay, so this is the point that I stopped writing for 3 days because I
   didn't know what to.... I just didn't know. Then decided where to go
   with it... and put it off for a good 5 hours after deciding. Little
   insight there.)
   And there's the problem.
   I've been throwing myself into everything else instead. (Note; makes it
   worse by the way, don't do it. Seriously.) Everything else was, is,
   more important. I knew what this felt like, I knew what it could do. To
   me. Make me feel. I got to a point where, I'm fairly certain, I
   couldn't get lower. But I dealt with it before. I also know what it did
   to everything and everyone around me too.
   You can't fix that. Or it's at least a damn sight harder to, if you
   can.
   Which is the point of this. I think.
   When things affect other people, directly or indirectly, you have to
   take responsibility for that. I have a responsibility for that.
   Responsibility is a substantial weight, one that weighs heavier when
   you deny it and hide from it. But I have been anyway, steadily,
   progressively, without direct intention. Maybe to hide, but never to
   hurt. I close everyone off, not because I want to, but because I don't
   know how not to.
   I drown myself in everything else so deeply, hoping to get deep enough
   that nothing else can touch me. Turns out, it's only the good things
   that can't touch you when you get down deep. The bad will always drop
   down with you.
   "Denial may be somewhat comforting but it hinders to healing and
   progression." - A very knowledgeable friend of mine.
   It's an isolation that suffocates you... but keeps you breathing.
   Being stuck in a place where you don't feel able to reach out no matter
   how desperately you want to. Confined and constricted, by nothing, but
   everything at once. Wanting to cling to those that you desperately
   can't bare to be in the vicinity of.
   Frustration, to the point it literally, physically, feels like it's
   hard to draw breath.
   A lump in your throat that feels like it's three times the size of the
   pipe it dwells in.
   Being so tense, it feels like my muscles will rupture from continuous,
   painfully strenuous contraction.
   Having someone say something to you and, literally, just.... nothing.
   Open your mouth and... nothing.
   But not always nothing, which sometimes is even worse. Because what
   does come out is often not what was supposed to, or how it was supposed
   to, or, just, not right.
   Ever had someone come up to you, a friend, and say something, anything,
   and instead of a response, even a hello, nothing happens? Nothing comes
   out. All you can do is make a cursory noise of remote acknowledgement
   and then leave the area?
   Even that's worse than nothing. It comes across incredibly rude if
   little else. The insight being; that played on my mind for days. I lie.
   It still is now.
   It's incredibly disheartening when you ask yourself a question like,
   'Why couldn't you just say 'Hi.'?!', and you actually have no viable
   answer.
   I became adept at faking it, but that's become oppressively harder the
   longer it's gone on.
   Dealing with people, any people, on a day to day basis had/has become
   one of the biggest challenges I've ever had to face.
   People at University, which I love.
   People at work, which, again, I genuinely relish.
   People at home.
   Strangers.
   Friends.
   Family.
   I've alienated people in every aspect of my life because of it.
   Which is where the apology comes in.
   It's perfectly truthful, I am fully accepting, that I've not been, am
   not, the greatest person to be around. Understatement of the year so
   far, I think, maybe.
   I'm not sure of much, but I'm sure I've come across as rude at times.
   Unthinking and inconsiderate. Inarticulate. Uncaring. Harsh. Oblivious.
   At times, downright unbearable.
   Which, for me, is especially horrible and painful. For that I
   unreservedly apologise. There has never been any intention to be that
   way.
   Now, this isn't something that has a beginning, middle and end,
   wrapping up all nicely in a package. A nice little, comfortable story.
   I'm still struggling now. I'm not going to deny that.
   I've said before that I feel trapped between 3 people in my life. Who I
   used to be, who I am now, and who I want to be. Maybe I'm further from
   who I want to be, and who I feel I truly am, than I was before. But I'm
   working on that. I'm working on how to do that.
   I'm trying,
   It turns out that's the point of all of this.
   I'm trying.

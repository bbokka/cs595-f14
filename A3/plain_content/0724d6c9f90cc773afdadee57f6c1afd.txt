   Association for Construction Career Development ACCD is a 501(c)3
   Non-Profit Organization

   ACCD was initiated by the Arizona Construction Career Days (AZCCD)
   event team in 2007. This came about due to the event becoming a larger
   event and needed more than just a committee; thus became the
   Association for Construction Career Development. We support the growing
   need for students, teachers and career counselors to understand better
   the many career opportunities that are available in the Construction
   Industry.
   Charmaine Foster-Flint, Bonnie Hall, Dave Nelson, Federal Highways
   Representative (Retired) and several ACCD members spearheaded AZCCD in
   1999.
   Humberto Martinez, National Construction Career Days Co-Founder, became
   our mentor during our planning stages of the first event. He has
   traveled to attend the event and experience the growth throughout the
   years.
   From the beginning, AZCCD has been an example of public-private
   partnerships. As evidence of the interest in the construction
   industries in the AZCCD events, our statistics show that there have
   been more than 340 exhibitors displays and 400 pieces of equipment.
   Our event is the largest construction event that reaches out to High
   School students throughout the State of Arizona to give them a hands-on
   construction experience.
   We've had schools travel from all over the State of Arizona. Some as
   many as 300 miles just to attend and find out more about a career in
   construction.
   Public-private partnerships remain central to the Construction Career
   Days concept and to the vision and mission of the ACCD. It is in
   working together and sharing information among the many industry
   partners that the construction industry is effectively promoted to
   Americas youth and the workforce of the 21st Century.
   The ACCD Board and AZCCD is made up entirely of volunteers who all have
   a passion for the Construction Industry and want to share it with our
   youth.
   In 2011 we created a Career Guide, which contains information for
   Career and Technical Education, Trades, Higher Education and lists our
   exhibitors and sponsors for the year. Each year we update it with
   current information. It is handed out to teachers and counselors when
   they attend the event and is available to download on our website.

   Hey guys! I'm sorry I haven't posted in a minute but I've been
   super-duper busy trying to stay alive. Senior year is legit kicking my
   butt...already. I knew it would be hard but I definitely didn't expect
   it to get real this fast. I'm currently using my study break to make
   this post while I eat my chicken noodle soup since I'm down with a
   cold. I think it's safe to say I'm over senior year but since I have
   about 8 months left, I need to find a way to survive.
   This past weekend, two of my darling friends had their birthday dinner.
   I wore this little black dress and paired it with some dark blue shoes.
   I loved the way I styled my Marley twists (thanks to youtube) and since
   it's almost my favorite season (autumn), dark lips were very
   appropriate.
   I'm going to do my best to post more regularly but for now, follow me
   on [16]instagram/[17]twitter for more recent updates and with that, I
   hope everyone enjoys the last few days of summer and embrace the cool
   fall breeze.

   It's officially senior year, y'all. I am finally on the last leg of
   this race--college.  I love Austin (on most days) but my time here is
   up. I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to get a great
   education at a great school but I'm beyond ready and excited for the
   next chapter which brings me to my very exciting news--as of right now,
   after graduation I will be doing research at the NIH for a year before
   heading off to medical school. DMV peeps, looks like I'm headed your
   way in a few months. Yayyy!
   My life this next few months will revolve around research, volunteer,
   18hrs of classes (mostly upper division bio classes), very little sleep
   and work. With all that being said, posts on here will be very limited
   but I promise to post whenever I do get a chance. You can always follow
   me on [35]Instagram and [36]Twitter for more recent updates.
   To officially kick off senior year, I saw my longhorns play in there
   opening game against North Texas and like always, It was amazing.
   Afterwards, I went out with some friends. Between pre-games, party bus
   and 6th street, my night was amazing! Although I woke up with a
   throbbing headache, I still managed to make it to church and lunch
   afterwards.
   I hope everyone enjoys their labor day weekend and good luck to my
   fellow class of 2015. Finish strong!

[43]YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

Posted on Thursday, August 14, 2014

   "To be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant stage of
   rage."- James Baldwin.
   You guessed right. This is in fact, a ranting post. I'm angry and this
   is the safest & least stressful way I know to release my anger.
   So, I'm annoyed and I'm irritated and I'm disgusted with America. I'm
   upset at the racist events that's all over the news, but I'm even more
   upset at non-POC people trying to unjustify my anger and the ones that
   claim to "understand" how I feel but go on to say, there is no such
   thing as "white privileges," Ok.
   Before I came to college, actually more like before my 3rd year in
   college, I could have easily passed as an "Uncle Tom." According to
   Ineye, we weren't uncle toms, necessarily. We just didn't have all the
   facts--we were ignorant. You see, being raised the way we were raised,
   you are sheltered from the truth. Also, according to Ineye, Being a
   non-american black in America adds a whole new dynamic to the idea of
   blackness. The simple explanation for that is, we didn't feel black
   until we got here. So, in our case, ignorance was bliss. It saved us
   from all the rage we were meant to feel or would have felt.
   I remained ignorant even after I got to college, but after taking
   African American courses, everything changed. I learned all about the
   history of this country that were not taught in middle school history
   classes. You see, the problem with becoming conscious and getting out
   of that shelter is that, you can't undo it. You see it everywhere,
   everytime and the rage you felt the first time resonates. It's
   exhausting.
   America would never let you forget about 9/11 (don't get me wrong, this
   is a huge part of our history), but ask a freshman in high school about
   Emmett Till, and watch their faces change like you just grew two heads.
   HYPOCRITES!
   The hypocrisy of America is not what I wish to talk about right now.
   Right at this moment, I'm upset at non-POC people that refuse to see
   the reasoning behind our anger.  Pointing out that MLK wanted us to be
   peaceful (FOX news) rather than riot is wrong on so many levels. He was
   peaceful but he still got killed, so please, just stop. We have every
   reason to be upset at the injustice in our society. I don't understand
   why anyone won't be upset but I've also learned that, people are
   complex!
   And to my non-POC friends/readers, please stop saying you understand
   how we feel when you don't even believe there is such thing as "white
   privileges" because I promise, you DO NOT UNDERSTAND. Imagine me
   telling a mother that just lost her child that I understand how she
   feels when I've never had a child of my own. So, I'm saying this with
   all the respect I can mutter, you really don't understand how we feel.
   I know you want to, but just like I will never understand how it feels
   to walk in your shoes, you will never understand how it feels to be
   told that you shouldn't wear your natural God given hair to an
   interview because it's not "professional" or understand how it feels to
   be told you only got into an ivy league school because of affirmative
   action when in reality, the main beneficiaries of A.A are white women.
   So, rather than succumbing to the urge of bringing examples of times
   when you suffered, just listen! We want to be heard and right now is
   not the time to make this about you and your life struggles--we've all
   struggled!

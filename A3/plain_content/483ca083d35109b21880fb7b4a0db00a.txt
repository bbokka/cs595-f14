[69]Guilt Free Deserts

   Enjoying a delicious dessert at the end of a great meal is one of
   life’s sweetest pleasures.
   [70][images%2B(28).jpg]
   Moist vanilla cupcakes with chocolate buttercream… warm pumpkin pie…
   crème brulée… carrot cake with cream cheese frosting… fresh brownies…
   Or just imagine the smell of freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies
   wafting from your kitchen…
   Just thinking about these decadent creations makes your mouth water and
   few of us have the willpower to resist.
   But we often feel guilty for indulging in sweet treats. After all, most
   desserts are filled with sugar, refined carbohydrates and unhealthy
   fats, and they pack more calories than the meal itself!
   Too many “sweet treats” like this will not only make you fat… it could
   ruin your health!
   But what if you could…
   Relax with a piece of New York cheesecake topped with raspberry sauce
   Satisfy your cravings with a warm slice of cinnamon apple crisp, or
   Enjoy chocolate rum balls and rich chocolate brownies…
   Without a care as to how it might affect your waistline or your health?
   And what if these desserts were not only irresistibly delicious, but
   good for you too?  [71]Continue.....

   Homemade wine ebook
   [111][Homemade+wine+ebook9.jpg]
   The day you open a bottle of that first really great batch... well,
   it's almost like watching your child walk for the first time.
   Just get some juice, put in some sugar, then throw in some yeast and
   let 'er rip.
   10 to 30 days later, you'll have something that slightly resembles
   wine.  It'll taste like crap and none of your friends or family will
   touch it - but it WILL be wine and it will have alcohol in it.

   Surf Workouts To Help You Catch More Waves And Get Fit For Your Next
   Surf Trip…
   [118][Fitness+training+surfersBen_Anton01.jpg]
   “I started the Total Surfing Fitness program exactly 12 weeks prior to
   my 1st overseas surfing trip to Bali in the hope of increasing my
   confidence and ability in the water.
   I’m a 37y/o and been surfing for 15 years. I found the TSF program
   suited my needs exactly. I surfed 2-3 times a day for 17 days straight
   and was confident in 2-8′ Impossibles, Ulluwatu, Balangan, Shipwrecks,
   Lacerations, Airport lefts and Kuta Reef without injury.
   I believe this would have been inconceivable without Total Surfing
   Fitness. I do not hesitate to recommend this program to anyone looking
   to improve their surfing fitness.” [119]Continue....

   We've long known that middle-aged men are much more likely than women
   to have high blood pressure--about 36 percent of men versus 23 percent

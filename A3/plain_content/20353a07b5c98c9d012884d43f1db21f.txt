[3]Day 25

   Day 25 - The person you know who is going through the worst of times
   I will never be able to fathom the excruciating plight you are in and I
   cannot extenuate the circumstances you have to go through physically,
   mentally and emotionally. Every single day, I pray for you and question
   the universe why did it have to be you? I cannot understand the logic
   of the universe; I do not see the rationale behind all that happened.
   Is there a silver lining? Will there ever be a rainbow after the
   thunderstorm?

     It's winter in my heart.

   There is nothing that I can do to extend some form of solace to you, or
   dial back the clock and make everything okay again. I'm sorry, but
   believe me when I say that every fibre in my being wants you to be
   okay, and I know you will be. It will always be okay, in the end.

     Hold on, pain ends.

   I remember...I remember everything, everything that you are to me. How
   your voice sends electricity through my fingertips and up my spine, how
   the touch of your hands...oh, your touch, each time it grazes the
   layers that envelope my bones, I feel my heart expand and constrict
   simultaneously - expand at the magnanimous love I bore for you and yet
   constricted by the tiny expanse of my thoracic cavity.
   I will remember...remember that in the face of a series of unfortunate
   events, there is something good in everyday. I remember that despite
   your circumstances, you told me to live my life and always look
   forward. I promise, I will live my life to the fullest, for you and for
   myself.
   It's not goodbye, it never will be; it's see you again.

[11]Hello from the land down under

   I don't think I ever publicly announced on my blog, but hello from the
   land down under and to be more specifically, Perth! An angmoh land
   infested with Asians (Asians EVERYWHERE, we're like pesky ants that's
   impossible to annihilate. Hehehe *snigger*) so there isn't so much of a
   culture clash for me, lol. I mean, there is a difference in culture,
   but I don't think it's a difference so drastic that I cannot adapt to
   or...maybe it's because I am pretty malleable.

         [12][10502517_10152604201399726_4138744700879632390_n.jpg]
      The beautiful beach by/at Fremantle. I don't know the name of the
     beach, but all you need to know is that it's at Fremantle AKA Freo
                    (hehehe, must learn the lingo here).

   I mentioned something about leaving my hometown, right? Well, here I
   am...in a foreign land that I am adapting to pretty well. Oh, a huge
   contributing factor is probably because there isn't any time difference
   from Malaysia so...y'know, no jet lags and whatnot, and my housemates
   are all hailed from Malaysia so...yeah, lol. I actually speak more
   Mandarin here than I did back in Malaysia - which totally contradicts
   the purpose of coming to an angmoh land to continue my studies lah.
   Hahahah, and I still end my sentences with lah, bah and whatnot. This
   Malaysian habit is seemingly IMPOSSIBLE to curb, but whatever lah,
   y'know? I am Malaysian, afterall.
   Perth has been pretty good to me. I found a church to go here and made
   fast friends. I'm also glad that I am able to find pretty decent
   groupmates for my group assignments. I mean, I don't really know yet,
   but it's all good so far. God bless that I'll be able to excel in my
   studies. :)

                   Taken at the Shipwreck Gallery Museum.

   How about coping with the different seasons here, you may wonder?
   Winter has been pretty chilly and I think we're gradually transiting
   into Spring so it's all good. It's still chilly and all, but it's like
   being in an air-conditioned room 24/7...except when there's wind gusts
   - which I'm not a huge fan of. Heard from various individuals that
   summer's not gonna be hunky dory 'though 'cause it's gonna be extremely
   hot. We'll see then and perhaps, I'll rant about how hot it is on my
   blog or I might not even experience summer in Oz because I'll be back
   in Malaysia. Haven't decided when I'll be flying back yet. Decisions,
   decisions.
   I think...I am gonna abruptly end this post here because I've run out
   of things to jibber jabber about so 'till then!

[22]I'm still letting you go

            IFRAME: [23]//www.youtube.com/embed/EBQrv2lLyvQ?rel=0

                  We wished on these stars, they were ours
                            They remind me of you
              I'm still letting you go, I just want you to know
                     That I think of you, think of you,
                         Think of you, think of you
                      The space in the back of my mind
               I meet you there to reminisce from time to time
                  You were the light, the blue in my skies
                   I saw the shades of myself in your eyes

   I don't know if it's because the surroundings no longer remind me of
   you, but I don't think of you as much as I did back at home. Thoughts
   of you used to be like a persistent throbbing of the head, a nagging
   headache that would never go away. Memories of you were etched in every
   piece of furniture, embedded in every road I travel. I could visualize
   your presence everywhere I went.
   Here...it's so hard to remember what it's like to feel your arms around
   my waist and your breath on the nape of my neck. It's been so long
   since we last saw each other. It's been even longer since I felt your
   touch and warmth. Hence, there are spaces in my mind that doesn't
   involve you.
   However, just because I don't think of you as much doesn't mean I don't
   think of you anymore. I still think of you every single day and in
   between gaping thoughts; you're the first in my everyday prayers. I
   miss you, so much.
   I'm still letting you go and I just want you to know that I think of
   you.

          Twenty-something. Hopeless romantic. Majoring M&M in Curtin
          University, but what I really want to do is to write. I am
          passionate about writing and I blog because one of my biggest
          fears is that I will one day lose all of my memories. --

Unlock Manchester
The Quality Guide for Manchester

   In 2013 Manchester saw 9.7 million visitors, staying for one night, of
   which 1.19 million where from international locations and they are
   spending £6.6bn in the local area.

   Unlock Manchester aims to bring a Quality Annual Guide to these
   visitors to engage them with the cities offerings including
   Entertainment, Shopping, Services and Events.

   The Guide will be a 'Coffee Table' style book available in many hotel
   rooms across the city. It will be the 'Manchester Year' and information
   will be presented in an easy to digest sectional format.

   It offers our advertising partners the opportunity to reach this
   growing market directly and benefit from their time spent visiting
   Manchester.

   The Guide’s printed edition will not carry adverts for Hotels or
   Restaurants, to avoid conflict with our hotel partners.

   Unlockmanchester.com is in pre-launch it will feature all the
   information carried in 'The Guide' plus further information about our
   partners and a 'What's On Guide'.
